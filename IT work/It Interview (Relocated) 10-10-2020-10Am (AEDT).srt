1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,510
Waiting for it to record.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,467
Very good. Thank you for joining
us, Steve. Really appreciate it.

3
00:00:10,467 --> 00:00:13,797
I know you've got value. Your
time is very valuable.

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:20,354
No problem. I will just
start if Stevie can introduce

5
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,826
yourself and your role.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,288
What you do?

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,920
Certainly so my name is Steven
Spiller. You can just call me

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,700
Steve. I work as a senior
software engineer in the Xbox or

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,170
get Microsoft. I work in a
little team is called. Let's not

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,010
so little anymore, but it's
called ATG, where the Advanced

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,011
Technology Group. And our role
in the organization is to help

12
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:49,620
game developers make the best
use of the platform of Xbox.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,408
And then specifically, I work in
networking and multiplayer

14
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:58,886
systems. So. So
yeah, I've titles are having

15
00:00:58,886 --> 00:01:02,582
trouble or they need advice or
they are behind this severely

16
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:06,614
behind and they can't get their
stuff to work on our platform.

17
00:01:06,614 --> 00:01:10,982
Our team is the one that helps
them out and save the day.

18
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,430
Exactly on the. It's not as
interesting on the networking

19
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,478
multiplayer side, but the on the
graphics side. Those are the

20
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:23,526
guys that really help titles
tune on our platform so they'll

21
00:01:23,526 --> 00:01:24,998
be able to take.

22
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,470
Basically traces the games
running, evaluate them, and

23
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,550
offer back tips that can help
them run faster so they'll get

24
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,290
games to run at least in the
previous generation. You know

25
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,670
all the way at 1080P instead of

26
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,020
only 900P. Things like that.
So really our goal is to make

27
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,076
all the titles that run on
Xbox the best they can be on

28
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:50,196
Xbox. I think that was our
motto at one time.

29
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,573
OK, now, well, I think
that answers the first

30
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:58,909
question of please tell
us about your artwork.

31
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,470
Can you tell us a little bit
about the industry that you're

32
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:10,326
working? So. I mean,
as being at Microsoft, I've done

33
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:14,670
a lot of things in a lot of
different areas, but most

34
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,014
recently we can just stay with
video games industry so the Xbox

35
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:22,272
stuff is what I've been working
on since 2013.

36
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,530
So the last seven years.

37
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,350
And mostly as a.

38
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,180
Is what Microsoft provides
platforms and services for

39
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,430
game developers.

40
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,464
And see I mean, it is a fairly
large industry, right? You've

41
00:02:41,464 --> 00:02:45,134
got billions of dollars and
millions of millions of gamers

42
00:02:45,134 --> 00:02:49,538
across the across the world. And
that's what we're trying to do.

43
00:02:49,538 --> 00:02:53,208
We're trying to make things
better and easier for gamers

44
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,309
across the entire.

45
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,998
I don't know panacea of the
world. Good way of saying that,

46
00:02:58,998 --> 00:03:00,882
but we want to make everybody.

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,628
Everybody's like he's here.

48
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,122
Is there any? I'm sorry, is what
other kinds of work do you have

49
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,787
to do in your role?

50
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:17,100
So in my role, I'll do things
like answer simple questions on

51
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,020
it. We have a.

52
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,720
Let's see that developer forum
that specific for Xbox Partners.

53
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,480
And so if they have issues,
that's one of the first places

54
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,620
they'll go, so I'll do a little
time answering those, and those

55
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,070
can be from really simple
questions like is this supposed

56
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,210
to work like this too? Hey,
we're getting a crash in this

57
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:44,350
very strange situation. Can you
help us figure that out? And so

58
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,800
I will investigate issues that
have been reported by external

59
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,595
developers. I work directly with
the platform team so the people

60
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:54,700
that actually, the ones that
wrote all the code.

61
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,190
Like I work with them to get
things figured out and resolve

62
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,410
bugs, find gaps in our our

63
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,953
solutions. I'm also developed
samples and demonstrate best

64
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:09,021
practices for using the platform
and our services. So like if you

65
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:11,733
want to know how to do
matchmaking, multiplayer

66
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:14,784
matchmaking through Xbox Live,
we have specific examples and

67
00:04:14,784 --> 00:04:18,852
lots of documentation that I put
together to help with that. And

68
00:04:18,852 --> 00:04:22,581
then of course if people still
have issues they can come

69
00:04:22,581 --> 00:04:23,598
straight to us.

70
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,780
Because we do work straight not
just from forums. We will also

71
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,905
engage via email lot more on
teams lately over the phone,

72
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,905
video conferencing, but will
also go straight to.

73
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,290
And sit on site with developers
to help them get issues resolved

74
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,590
or to help them get their game
working on Xbox is.

75
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,872
And I've I've done that several
times. Which is it's kind of

76
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:50,708
fun. It's very busy though.

77
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,563
We also deliver content for what
used to be in person

78
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:01,794
conferences. I don't know. We
had to cancel the last few and

79
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:04,842
turn them into digital only and
I don't know what the future

80
00:05:04,842 --> 00:05:07,890
holds as far as those go, but we
have several annual conferences.

81
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,813
Directed around Xbox developers
in gaming and we provide

82
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,060
educational. Training and.

83
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,626
However, there you know Doug,
discussion sessions and Whatnot

84
00:05:20,626 --> 00:05:24,514
where people actually come out
and and listen to us talk, which

85
00:05:24,514 --> 00:05:26,134
is just kind of fun.

86
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,540
I think that covers almost
everything I do right now.

87
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,514
Think that also covers the
different people that you

88
00:05:33,514 --> 00:05:35,376
interact with in your job,
wouldn't it?

89
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,118
Yes, so I mean I do a lot of
different things as you could

90
00:05:41,118 --> 00:05:44,660
tell right? And those have
different people I work with, so

91
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,202
when we're developing new
samples we want them to have a

92
00:05:48,202 --> 00:05:51,422
consistent look and feel. So we
actually have designers, graphic

93
00:05:51,422 --> 00:05:55,286
designers that help us design
the UI flows and figure out what

94
00:05:55,286 --> 00:05:57,218
the scenarios that we want to

95
00:05:57,218 --> 00:06:01,513
show. Program managers who
actually are the we call them

96
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:05,440
the butt on the line. So the
people that actually own

97
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,653
features that are responsible
for making sure that they're

98
00:06:08,653 --> 00:06:11,866
status distract correctly that
they're doing the right thing.

99
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,594
All that work other software
developers obviously, and then

100
00:06:15,594 --> 00:06:19,832
we have another special type of
person in the Xbox Org that we

101
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:23,092
call developer account managers
and these are the people that

102
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:25,700
actually own the relationship
with the different publishers

103
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,286
and Whatnot. So we have one
person that owns Electronic Arts

104
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:33,198
and so when Electronic Arts has
any sort of problems, they need

105
00:06:33,198 --> 00:06:36,784
to do something they want to ask
about future plans. Anything

106
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:40,370
related to this? They talked
their damn and then their damn

107
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,630
will be the one that often
Contacts us with specific

108
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,495
issues. Or other problems they
might be having, or if they just

109
00:06:47,495 --> 00:06:49,385
want advice on things, runs the

110
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:54,580
gamut. And then those roles are
internal people. Then of course

111
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,490
externals, which I think falls
more under your clients, yeah?

112
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,290
Alright um.

113
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,630
You can you tell us about
your interactions with other

114
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,488
IT professionals.

115
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,788
I wasn't quite sure what you
mean by this, so I mean I have.

116
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,252
There's five people I might
immediate team or my peers, and

117
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:21,304
we all basically work on the

118
00:07:21,304 --> 00:07:26,620
same thing. Then we roll up.
There's a bunch of teams like

119
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,638
mine that take on the different
areas of Xbox. So you add audio

120
00:07:31,638 --> 00:07:33,182
graphics. Ours is networking.

121
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,030
Systems and CPU and things like
that, but then of course you

122
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,550
have the whole platform side of
things where the guys that

123
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,390
actually write the OS they write
the special Xbox layers on top

124
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,310
of things and we interact with

125
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,058
them quite often. So you
wouldn't have much interactions

126
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:56,371
with other club with the clients
directly or investors, I would

127
00:07:56,371 --> 00:08:02,830
say. So most of the work
I do is direct clients.

128
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,252
So either through a forum,
through email, through teams.

129
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,015
You know, up and up and up to on

130
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:14,940
site visits. Yeah.

131
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,650
Yeah, but some of that would be
facilitated through their

132
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:26,065
clients DM as well. Yeah, so the
the DMS will will set up what we

133
00:08:26,065 --> 00:08:30,036
call an engagement. So if
there's a real problem we need

134
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:32,202
to set aside time to actually.

135
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:36,172
It's going to take more than a
day or so to look at this.

136
00:08:36,172 --> 00:08:39,002
They'll set up what's called an
engagement, and then, depending

137
00:08:39,002 --> 00:08:42,398
on the level of that and then
other factors like, where are

138
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:44,276
they located physically?
Travel restrictions, things

139
00:08:44,276 --> 00:08:47,928
like that. So if there's a
developer that's just down the

140
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:52,244
street and there are some that
are like that, we will just go

141
00:08:52,244 --> 00:08:53,572
there 'cause it's easier.

142
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,344
Other times, yeah, we can do
things over the phone and over

143
00:08:58,344 --> 00:09:01,611
email and that that actually
works out fairly well and it's

144
00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:05,769
nice 'cause it has a paper trail
so we can go back and reference

145
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:09,333
this stuff again. So anytime we
go and we solve problems, we

146
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,006
figure something out. We have
this big knowledge base.

147
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,265
It's really a OneNote now. We
stuck all this information and

148
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:17,625
so we can go back and search for

149
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:22,998
it again. Sometimes the easiest
tools are the best tools.

150
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,026
Think it So what would you find
that you spend the most time on

151
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:32,334
in your role at would be the
networking side of things or

152
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:33,770
more solving client issues?

153
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,040
That is almost like a sine wave,
right? We will go from where we

154
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,560
are doing nothing but working
with customers and right now is

155
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,720
one of those times we have the
new launch of the console coming

156
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,840
up in a month and we have a ton
of titles that are all trying to

157
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,360
certify they're trying to get
their stuff updated to the new

158
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,200
platform work so there's a lot
of people all working in with

159
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,720
new things all at the same time,
so we're quite busy.

160
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,194
Answering questions and helping
people figure out that how

161
00:10:05,194 --> 00:10:07,854
things are supposed to work.
These days they were already

162
00:10:07,854 --> 00:10:11,046
started about that new Xbox. I
know it's great, isn't it? And

163
00:10:11,046 --> 00:10:14,504
then on the other side of that,
so you'll have these big lulls

164
00:10:14,504 --> 00:10:17,164
where people just they've become
familiar with the platforms and

165
00:10:17,164 --> 00:10:19,824
the systems. They don't have
issues as much anymore where

166
00:10:19,824 --> 00:10:21,686
there's just not a lot of work

167
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:26,100
going on. 'cause you know it is
somewhat cyclical as to when

168
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,692
software or dog software
specifically, but games are

169
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:33,878
released. During those times we
get to work on what we think of

170
00:10:33,878 --> 00:10:37,418
is more forward looking items,
so we will have incubation

171
00:10:37,418 --> 00:10:41,312
projects for new tools, new
ideas, new services, as well as

172
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:45,206
being able to do work where
we're building up new samples

173
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:48,980
new. I'm trying to think new
middleware projects. So one

174
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,300
thing that we don't offer a lot
of his middleware and by that I

175
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,580
mean things like the unity and

176
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,154
unreal engine's. A lot of
developers go to those because

177
00:11:00,154 --> 00:11:05,374
it it's pre cat has a lot of
stuff so we work with epic and

178
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:08,854
unity to have Xbox platform
support built in for everybody

179
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:13,030
and so sometimes we will do
things like that. In fact, just

180
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,858
recently one of my colleagues
and I finished adding a new

181
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:20,686
platform piece that's called
play fat party on Xbox which is

182
00:11:20,686 --> 00:11:23,818
a pre canned voice, an
networking solution an now

183
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:27,646
that's something that you can
choose to use if you use.

184
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:31,511
In real you gonna say Yep, I
wanna use that piece. You check

185
00:11:31,511 --> 00:11:34,481
the box and basically it just
automatically starts using it

186
00:11:34,481 --> 00:11:38,045
'cause it's built into their
engine. So we do some of that

187
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:41,609
work too and that's a lot of
fun, right? That's when you're

188
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:44,282
spending more time coding then
troubleshooting and other times

189
00:11:44,282 --> 00:11:47,252
it's more troubleshooting coding
since it's actually one of the

190
00:11:47,252 --> 00:11:49,906
things I like. It comes up

191
00:11:49,906 --> 00:11:54,946
later. I think a lot of us would
like to spend more time coding

192
00:11:54,946 --> 00:11:58,048
than dealing with some of the
clients. Yeah, there, it's it's

193
00:11:58,048 --> 00:12:01,714
really hard. I mean, I've worked
in a lot of different types of

194
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:04,816
groups around Microsoft and no
matter what, there is never a

195
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:07,636
job where you're just spending
all your time writing code.

196
00:12:07,636 --> 00:12:11,020
There's just too many other
things that have to be done as

197
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,404
part of the process of shipping
software that you can't get away

198
00:12:14,404 --> 00:12:20,680
from. What aspects of your work
would you find most challenging?

199
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:26,105
So what I find personally most
challenging often is.

200
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,661
Trying to understand each
different developers actual

201
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:32,763
needs so a lot of times they'll
come and say Hey I'm trying to

202
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:36,572
do this and it's not working
right. Can you tell me what the

203
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:39,795
problem is? And well, yes, I
could tell you specifically why

204
00:12:39,795 --> 00:12:43,311
that isn't working, but this
seems like it's a symptom of a

205
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:46,827
larger issue, right? You may be
doing something at a more meta

206
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:50,050
level. That's incorrect as far
as the pattern that you should

207
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,028
follow. So we really need to
spend the time or you know to

208
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:58,812
understand what the goal is.
What are they trying to achieve

209
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:02,940
and what limitations they have
so that we can then find the

210
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,412
right way to solve that problem
for them or to help them solve

211
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:11,196
the problem. And then of course
you know things sometimes that

212
00:13:11,196 --> 00:13:15,324
works out really well and
sometimes you go on and on and

213
00:13:15,324 --> 00:13:18,764
being a global product sometimes
is challenging just with the

214
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,860
translations. So some things we
have where I'm saying.

215
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,074
Trying to say like when I work
with the Japanese developer, we

216
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:27,694
have an intermediary that
translates back and forth for us

217
00:13:27,694 --> 00:13:30,576
so well like all type of
response, they'll go in and

218
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,196
translate it. The other person
will then type their response.

219
00:13:33,196 --> 00:13:35,816
That'll get translated back and
it's kind of interesting, but

220
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:39,222
you can lose a lot easier. That
looks a bit in translation, so

221
00:13:39,222 --> 00:13:42,104
yeah, it does make it take
longer, and sometimes you just

222
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:44,986
you don't. It doesn't come out
in translation exactly. You do

223
00:13:44,986 --> 00:13:48,916
lose what it is. I had one on
from like, oh, I thought I saw

224
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:52,060
that they were asking for, but
then they came back and asked.

225
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,180
Yes, it came back a slightly
different way. Like oh OK, I

226
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,240
guess they meant this other
thing and so that can be a

227
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,263
challenge. Um? But Secondly, the
with the complexity of all the

228
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,750
systems and how they have to
work together like you wouldn't

229
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,237
believe how many things are
involved from you. Sit on your

230
00:14:10,237 --> 00:14:14,675
Xbox sending an invite to one of
your friends to play a game and

231
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:19,113
for them to receive it and join
and be able to play. There are

232
00:14:19,113 --> 00:14:22,600
many many steps and different
systems that all the things flow

233
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,800
through. Sometimes it is really
hard to find a root cause,

234
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,331
right? You'll say, Oh, I have
this problem. It's it's showing

235
00:14:30,331 --> 00:14:33,862
up. Because of this, the user
won't sign in correctly, but

236
00:14:33,862 --> 00:14:36,751
it's not actually assigning
problem, but it actually turns

237
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,924
out that that user is part of
this title group that has this

238
00:14:40,924 --> 00:14:44,134
special properties set that only
works in this other situation,

239
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:47,665
right? And it takes 510 people
sometimes on an email thread

240
00:14:47,665 --> 00:14:51,196
just to figure out what the
what's supposed to happen, what

241
00:14:51,196 --> 00:14:53,443
is happening and how we can fix

242
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:58,610
it. I'm glad that showed up. And
to be fair a lot of times fixing

243
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:02,060
it means telling the title
developer that they were doing

244
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,855
something wrong, so it's not
always our fault, but I usually

245
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:10,045
take that. Angle first that I
take the assumption that it's

246
00:15:10,045 --> 00:15:13,620
something that our stuff is
doing wrong and then let people

247
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,545
discover that it's not
necessarily the case. I think

248
00:15:16,545 --> 00:15:20,120
the end users will just blame
you guys anyway, wouldn't I?

249
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,370
Yeah yeah, sometimes it's really
hard to read Twitter comments

250
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,970
because the lack of actual
understanding is frustrating

251
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,245
when you read some of the things

252
00:15:28,245 --> 00:15:31,660
I say. Yeah.

253
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,701
Finally, can you show finally
for this group of questions? Can

254
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:41,222
you share an example of your
work? The best captures the

255
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:45,332
essence of the IT industry or
your role they suppose.

256
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:51,008
Yes, So what is the essence I've
when I thought about it, I came

257
00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:54,221
up with the definition that was
it's basically utilizing

258
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:58,862
technology to accomplish tasks
or to get work done. And if I go

259
00:15:58,862 --> 00:16:03,503
by that I would say that when we
were developing our samples and

260
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:07,787
it sound well I didn't really
giving you the scope of what

261
00:16:07,787 --> 00:16:11,714
samples are. Samples do range
from like one code file that

262
00:16:11,714 --> 00:16:15,998
just does something really
simple to a full game. We have a

263
00:16:15,998 --> 00:16:20,282
full game. That example is a
sample for a bunch of different

264
00:16:20,282 --> 00:16:23,846
things. Which is a lot of fun to

265
00:16:23,846 --> 00:16:28,103
work on. So by doing that and
having those out there, when we

266
00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:31,436
developed them, we developed in
this that they would pass our

267
00:16:31,436 --> 00:16:34,163
own certifications that they
follow all our own best

268
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:38,102
practices so that it's a working
example of the right way to do

269
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:42,041
it. And nice thing about doing
that is that a lot of developers

270
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:45,374
will just take that code
directly and they'll make it fit

271
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:49,313
in their engine so we know then
with when they take that they're

272
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:52,949
taking code that we've developed
and tested and we know will pass

273
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:54,161
certification and they're just

274
00:16:54,161 --> 00:16:57,607
using it. So it's it's kind of
win win and I think that's

275
00:16:57,607 --> 00:16:59,663
actually one of those
synergistic things where you

276
00:16:59,663 --> 00:17:02,490
gain more out of the end
results. Again, with the effort

277
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,032
that was put into it initially.

278
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,318
It also makes support easier for
it as well. I'm sorry you said

279
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:12,510
again, will also make support
easy for it as well if they're

280
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,702
using your examples. So yes,
yeah, in fact, that's one of my

281
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,894
favourites. Goto is hey, I'm
trying to use chat and my chat

282
00:17:18,894 --> 00:17:21,820
doesn't work in this situation
like well. Can you load the

283
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,012
sample and see if the sample has
the same problem right? The

284
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:27,406
samples the same problem then?
We're probably looking at

285
00:17:27,406 --> 00:17:30,066
something had changed or broken
the platform and we can

286
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:33,524
investigate that way if it works
in the sample then we can narrow

287
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:36,982
it down to OK. Well, it must be
something in the way you're

288
00:17:36,982 --> 00:17:42,318
calling the code. Let's focus on
that work and in so yes it does.

289
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:44,358
It does help a lot.

290
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,944
I'm going to leave the last few
questions for Mattie to answer

291
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:54,311
up to ask and go from there.
Matt, Are you ready?

292
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,766
Hi, I'm just for the sake of
simplicity when it comes to

293
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:03,924
audio, I'll just ask the next
few questions which came from

294
00:18:03,924 --> 00:18:09,216
one from each of us. So Daniel
wanted to know do you work from

295
00:18:09,216 --> 00:18:14,508
home at all and if so do you
prefer it to working in the

296
00:18:14,508 --> 00:18:19,422
office? Or if not, would you
like to work from home at least

297
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:23,202
some days? Yes, so current
situations aside, I had been

298
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,092
working about 5050 between home

299
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:29,570
and office. And I found that to
be a really good balance for me.

300
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,980
'cause I do enjoy the comfort
and convenience of being at

301
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,700
home, right? I can just get up.
I have everything around me.

302
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,800
It's it's simple, but there's
times when I'm working with

303
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,210
people directly or we're trying
to troubleshoot issues or I need

304
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,930
more equipment than I have
rights at work. I have a stack

305
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,340
of Xbox Dev kits that can
utilized in many different ways

306
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,750
to do things at home. I only
have two and it's.

307
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:58,316
You know I can't do as many
things and it's more difficult,

308
00:18:58,316 --> 00:19:02,372
more time consuming to do
certain things, but I do like to

309
00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:06,428
work from home and I will keep
when we do openoffice backup.

310
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:08,118
Stick to our 5050 style.

311
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,050
That's that's a surprising
answer, because I guess we might

312
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:17,400
have thought you would have
worked mainly in the office

313
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,546
before covid. But yeah, that
does sound like a lovely

314
00:19:21,546 --> 00:19:25,190
balance. Um, so Adam wanted to
know what aspect of your work do

315
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,810
you find most enjoyable and why?

316
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,598
The things I enjoy the most is
when I provide a solution or an

317
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:36,762
answer to somebody and they come
back with oh thank you this

318
00:19:36,762 --> 00:19:40,926
works. I've been working this
forever and I could beat my head

319
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:45,090
over and you solve my problem.
Thank you so much, right? So

320
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,825
when I help people solve

321
00:19:46,825 --> 00:19:50,831
problems. That's just that's my
favorite thing. That's what I

322
00:19:50,831 --> 00:19:54,659
enjoy the end up getting the
most enjoyment out of. I mean,

323
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:57,211
there's personal satisfaction
with doing your own projects,

324
00:19:57,211 --> 00:20:00,401
and these things like that, but
when you, when somebody

325
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:03,910
physically tells you hey, you
solve my problem and helped me,

326
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:08,057
I really like that. Yeah, that
must be a lovely feeling and I

327
00:20:08,057 --> 00:20:12,204
think we can relate when we're
able to help someone out. And I

328
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:16,351
also really enjoy the fact that
my job is so eclectic at times

329
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:20,179
that I'm not in the same rut of
doing the same things.

330
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:25,350
Each each task each problems a
new challenge, almost, so it's

331
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,190
it keeps it interesting.

332
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,750
So you like the variability?

333
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,456
Oh Uh, so my question was, what
advice would you give to someone

334
00:20:35,456 --> 00:20:38,972
who is just beginning to study
or work in the IT industry?

335
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:45,934
So it's gone a long way for me
is to find areas that you're

336
00:20:45,934 --> 00:20:48,164
really interested in and then.

337
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,406
Kind of saturate yourself
with that.

338
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,778
And really, the biggest the
biggest thing you can do to help

339
00:20:57,778 --> 00:21:00,291
yourself is to do it hands on.

340
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:04,954
So if there's if you think that
you know configuring and running

341
00:21:04,954 --> 00:21:07,243
server farms is going to be fun.

342
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:12,836
Go out to Azure or someplace
where you can get free VM space

343
00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:16,940
for tinkering and do it. Do it
over and over again. Try

344
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,018
different things, break it
because you will break it.

345
00:21:20,018 --> 00:21:23,780
Figure out what you did wrong.
Basically. Now give yourself a

346
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,884
sandbox to play in because that
immersion is what, at least for

347
00:21:27,884 --> 00:21:31,554
me. Makes everything else come
together more easily.

348
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:37,595
Sixense Oh yeah, so um practiced
I just study.

349
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:44,430
Right yes. Anne Shannon wanted
to know, do you find it hard

350
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,265
keeping skills slash learning
up-to-date? So there's a That's

351
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:51,675
a yes or no for me since we are
providing we is Xbox, Microsoft

352
00:21:51,675 --> 00:21:54,825
provide new services and new
technologies all the time. It's

353
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:59,550
just kind of part of my job to
learn and know that is that are

354
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,385
being developed and has we're
supporting them and helping

355
00:22:02,385 --> 00:22:04,275
other people figure out. How do

356
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:09,372
we use them. But I don't have
alot of time to invest in skills

357
00:22:09,372 --> 00:22:14,020
outside of my job right now. So
if I decided I wanted to learn

358
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,672
something that's unrelated to my
job, I would really have to

359
00:22:17,672 --> 00:22:19,996
spend most of my private time to

360
00:22:19,996 --> 00:22:24,290
do it and. It's just I mean, if
it's something you really love

361
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,095
then great, but it's harder to
invest in something that you

362
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,410
don't know will pay off when
it's taking up that much of your

363
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:35,878
time. In my situation so it can
be hard, but it can also.

364
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,520
You know, if you put yourself in
the right position, they didn't

365
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,150
just come along with the
territory. Do you find that's a

366
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,690
result of. The release date
coming up and covered or is is

367
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:51,134
that always the way with your
job over the past seven years?

368
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,290
Ah.

369
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:59,016
It's it's been more
lately, obviously.

370
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,275
It's the way I do things, like
when I find something that I'm

371
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:07,705
interested in and I want to do
it. I'm just going to do it

372
00:23:07,705 --> 00:23:11,135
right now. That's why I choose
to spend my free time on if that

373
00:23:11,135 --> 00:23:13,340
happens to be learning new
technology, then that's that

374
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,770
works out. In that case alot of
times though, I tend to want to

375
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:21,233
go back and. Do things that I
would find more relaxing I

376
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,303
guess, so doing more retro
things, going back and playing

377
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:27,680
on the old Apple that ers 80s
old game console programming.

378
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,260
You know something simplistic.
It doesn't have to go anywhere.

379
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,186
It may or may not help you in
the in what you're currently

380
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:36,998
doing, but it's it does still

381
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:40,055
help you. Or if it helps you

382
00:23:40,055 --> 00:23:45,214
bet. Yeah, you keep using your
your skills fresh. I guess the

383
00:23:45,214 --> 00:23:49,328
more you do different things,
the easier it is to switch

384
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:54,100
between things. And, Um, George
wanted to know what do you think

385
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,928
are the most important skills
and attributes for a job like

386
00:23:57,928 --> 00:24:03,320
this? I'm sorry that means, like
my job specifically, then we're

387
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,148
looking at having strong
troubleshooting skills, good

388
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:09,380
knowledge of relevant
technologies, so most games are

389
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,824
written in C++. If you don't
know C++ very well, you'll

390
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,460
probably have a hard time
understanding why certain things

391
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,500
do certain things because you're
not feeling with what side

392
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,944
effects are or how memory is
treated and what not. Equally,

393
00:24:25,944 --> 00:24:27,964
if you're not familiar with

394
00:24:27,964 --> 00:24:32,120
rest. APIs over the web.
You could easily make a lot

395
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,858
of mistakes.

396
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,370
So basically, uh, patients

397
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:42,588
and. The dedication to be able
to complete tasks. That's one of

398
00:24:42,588 --> 00:24:46,764
the hardest things I find
between myself and a lot of my

399
00:24:46,764 --> 00:24:50,244
programmer friends is we all
have a million side projects

400
00:24:50,244 --> 00:24:51,636
that never get done.

401
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:55,106
If you can actually sit down and
make yourself go through the

402
00:24:55,106 --> 00:24:57,986
process of doing everything to
completeness, that just makes it

403
00:24:57,986 --> 00:25:01,154
makes it easier because you've
practiced it and your life will

404
00:25:01,154 --> 00:25:04,322
be better anyway, because you
won't have things coming back to

405
00:25:04,322 --> 00:25:05,474
haunt you as much.

406
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,170
So you'd say dedication and.

407
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,890
A good understanding of.

408
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:16,920
The skills that they the job
requires initially and are

409
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:22,116
going. And patient was another
good one, sometimes it's.

410
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,950
It's really hard. You'll and one
of my colleagues was having this

411
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,700
issue today where he just
couldn't get a problem that

412
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,450
somebody reported to reproduce
even with their own code. And

413
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:35,300
he's like I just don't know what
to do anymore. I just don't. I'm

414
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,150
stuck. Like, Well, let's just
keep going through it and you

415
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,798
just kind of keep trucking and
eventually things pop up or you

416
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,142
figure something out. But if you
put it aside or you.

417
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,084
Yeah, you kind of give up on it
then you obviously can't do that

418
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:53,838
too much when you're getting
paid for it, but.

419
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,152
Anne helps overall, yeah, and
Sam wanted to know what new,

420
00:25:58,152 --> 00:26:02,856
what new skills do you think
will be in demand in the

421
00:26:02,856 --> 00:26:04,424
industry in five years?

422
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,566
Oh well, the big future
investments these days are

423
00:26:09,566 --> 00:26:13,358
around artificial intelligence,
machine learning and big data

424
00:26:13,358 --> 00:26:17,946
processing. In games, especially
machine learning, and not until

425
00:26:17,946 --> 00:26:22,313
just for games, as in like
gameplay, but systems that are

426
00:26:22,313 --> 00:26:27,871
in used to make games. So I mean
a game is really about moving

427
00:26:27,871 --> 00:26:32,238
and manipulating large chunks of
data over and over and over

428
00:26:32,238 --> 00:26:37,260
again. So if you can have a
computer that can use a machine

429
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,680
learning Type, 2 minute can look
and evaluate. Hey, I seem to be

430
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,080
loading these chunks from this
specific place on this interval

431
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,160
in this mode, so I'm going to
self optimize this. An prefetch

432
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,920
things that I think are going to
come up and by simply doing that

433
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,000
you've all of a sudden increased
your load times for your game

434
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,080
and for other things. As an
example, AI would be more along

435
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,120
the lines of if you having

436
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,846
smarter. Systems to you

437
00:27:07,846 --> 00:27:12,975
in the. Player interaction
systems. So the computer is

438
00:27:12,975 --> 00:27:17,955
doing more and the players doing
this or the creators are doing

439
00:27:17,955 --> 00:27:22,761
this. It's if you think about it
as when you're developing the

440
00:27:22,761 --> 00:27:26,973
game you you know there's a
certain certain way you go about

441
00:27:26,973 --> 00:27:31,185
doing things and you try to
optimize for what you think are

442
00:27:31,185 --> 00:27:35,046
going to be. The most common
scenarios, but you don't really

443
00:27:35,046 --> 00:27:40,311
know what those are going to be,
and even if you do find the most

444
00:27:40,311 --> 00:27:44,523
common scenarios, what if it's
only 60% of your users and the

445
00:27:44,523 --> 00:27:48,033
other 40% are having a less than
perfect experience using

446
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,086
something like Emil?

447
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:51,738
The software itself could make
the determination and

448
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:54,386
dynamically pick the best
optimizations for you, instead

449
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:58,358
of having to statically choose
ones that you hope are the right

450
00:27:58,358 --> 00:27:59,682
ones ahead of time.

451
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:06,545
That's great. I think that was
all the questions we had.

452
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:11,482
Um, did we want to ask any
follow up questions to those or

453
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:13,352
we all happy with bash?

454
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,770
I think that was really

455
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:21,062
informative. So much for

456
00:28:21,062 --> 00:28:26,070
that, yeah? We really appreciate
your time and I'm not sure how

457
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,568
long we've been recording now,
but you've just come home from

458
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:33,702
work and put in the extra effort
for us, so we really appreciate

459
00:28:33,702 --> 00:28:36,470
it. Thanks Rob.

460
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:41,632
I love to help. Like I said, I
volunteer at my local high

461
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:45,572
school and help the kids there
with programming classes. Great,

462
00:28:45,572 --> 00:28:50,196
that's fantastic. Well, I guess
we won't talk about take up

463
00:28:50,196 --> 00:28:55,284
anymore of your time and just
hope you have a lovely day.

464
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,700
And I have a nice relaxing,

465
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,230
lovely night. Anything you want
to ask again, or for any reason,

466
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:08,780
whatever Adam can get ahold of
me. Yeah, if you want to feel

467
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,980
free. It's been great getting to
know you and learning about your

468
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,850
work. Steve, thank you so much.

469
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:19,440
Thank you. Thanks you too.

470
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,300
See ya.

471
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,545
It's

472
00:29:25,545 --> 00:29:29,080
frozen.

473
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:36,348
Thanks.
Yeah, it's alright.

474
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:40,991
The guy from Xbox should give us
some good marks. Oh yeah, yeah,

475
00:29:40,991 --> 00:29:44,918
we'll put him to put him to
shame. Obviously hopeless like

476
00:29:44,918 --> 00:29:50,518
the recording. I'll just Shannon
just sent a message. I'll ask

477
00:29:50,518 --> 00:29:54,312
him if he wants to Join Now.

478
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:01,110
Did you wanna stop the
the meeting recording? Yeah.
