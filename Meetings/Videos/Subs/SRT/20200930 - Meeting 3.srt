1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:09,006
Right, yeah? Cool, just quickly
run through the gender that I

2
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:14,814
set out the progress report on
the content as the project I

3
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:21,590
dear update, just sort of a part
of the first one and then review

4
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,914
and confirm group roles that
content calls. If we feel like

5
00:00:26,914 --> 00:00:31,270
it then just general group
questions and issues. Maybe

6
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,690
questions for Tim and schedule

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,971
next meeting. For the next

8
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:41,330
meeting. But yeah, I don't know
if we can just go buy one by one

9
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,570
and report on the.

10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,540
Progress of the content that

11
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,840
we've done. Section.

12
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:56,470
Yeah, I guess we can go
section by section, yeah?

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,045
Yeah, I did a quick run through
before and it looks like we've

14
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:07,295
started all this sections that
we can't 'cause. There's a

15
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:10,695
couple like the feedback
feedback in Group reflection.

16
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:14,945
Gotta wait until Week 6 or 7,
probably Week 7.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,340
But we may decide on pretty much
everything. So we I think

18
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,715
looking in a decent position.

19
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:28,834
But I'm pretty focused. It's
running a meeting so I don't

20
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:31,154
really know what I'm doing,

21
00:01:31,154 --> 00:01:35,306
sorry. Well, I've come, I
haven't started too much

22
00:01:35,306 --> 00:01:38,879
of my section my, you
know the four different.

23
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,580
Things we have to do.

24
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,961
Yeah, I haven't done much of
mine 'cause I was doing some of

25
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:50,668
the weekly work. I haven't even
seen this weeks meeting from

26
00:01:50,668 --> 00:01:54,375
Anthony just yet, so I haven't
actually made much progress at

27
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:54,712
all.

28
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:02,845
Really.
Yeah, but I what weight is it?

29
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:04,665
Do you I forget?

30
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,260
We still have like another three
weeks, I think or.

31
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,872
We're doing pretty good
considering, yeah, other people

32
00:02:13,872 --> 00:02:15,768
don't have groups yet.

33
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,778
Yeah. I started the website.

34
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,040
Yes, it looks good I.

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,292
I haven't actually looked at it
yet. I haven't added the team

36
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:30,721
profile pictures. I just took
yours Mattie from canvas.

37
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,637
'cause I didn't get back till
just now. So sorry that's

38
00:02:35,637 --> 00:02:38,019
alright. That's The One I gave

39
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:43,313
you anyway. I just went with
like two different colors of

40
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:48,450
Grey 'cause I didn't know what
colors used wanted to pick.

41
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,589
I can change that at any point.

42
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:58,154
I don't what was the little
animation I've oh it's a little

43
00:02:58,154 --> 00:03:01,190
PAC man. Yeah.

44
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,280
So while I do the content in the
background so it's actually

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,360
ready to display rather than you
see half loading pictures, it

46
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,440
will just display that until
everything is ready to go, and

47
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,520
then they'll receive the whole
page in one here. Oh, that's

48
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,600
that's cool. Yeah, is that like
a JavaScript thing? Yeah, I

49
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,680
commented all the code there,
'cause in case you guys wanted

50
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,286
to use it. So you can just read
that and write the comments, and

51
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:28,166
it's all explains what I'm

52
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,370
doing. Retain profiles when you
click on a picture, it's going

53
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,318
to open up a like a window on
the page in JavaScript and then.

54
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,540
You should be able to say that
if you go to that and just yeah,

55
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,160
it looks great. Love it.

56
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,070
Yeah. It's amazing.

57
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,558
So I thought, you know, we might
as well add some class to the

58
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:56,155
site. The other team's a little

59
00:03:56,155 --> 00:04:00,758
bit. Maybe will distract him
with all the fancy stuff it does

60
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:04,160
anyway. Write anything and just
give us full marks.

61
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,210
No, you didn't put any of

62
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:12,240
the flashy. Strophic strobe
lighting on there. Yeah Oh no,

63
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,790
not yet. Not yet. Not so work in
progress might be randomly when

64
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,340
you click on one of the team
profiles, it'll just load up a

65
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,440
disco ball in the corner and

66
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,500
just. Like a disco.

67
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,410
So has anyone had time to work
on their pieces?

68
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,040
Uh, yeah I I did my cloud
service services and serves

69
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,284
servers. Uh, yeah I am

70
00:04:41,284 --> 00:04:45,154
researching. For that for the
last three days, right?

71
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,761
Got some echo from you
George. Yeah I know I can

72
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:50,166
hear myself with a little.

73
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,460
Alright, I'll do this hello.

74
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,240
Translator

75
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:03,368
No. Sorry,
but no.

76
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,644
I don't know. Is your microphone
too close to your speaker?

77
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,962
I'm just using the fine now.
I think maybe the connector

78
00:05:14,962 --> 00:05:20,146
came out a little bit and it
was using the speaker audio

79
00:05:20,146 --> 00:05:21,442
or something, yeah?

80
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,200
Sounds better, yes, better now,

81
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,110
yeah. OK cool yeah. Well, I've
been researching that for the

82
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,758
last three days and I've done
all of that. So if you're

83
00:05:31,758 --> 00:05:33,582
anybody wants to have read in.

84
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,940
You know, have any like a
feedback on that? I'll be good.

85
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:45,438
Uh, yeah. So I just done that
and then I did my profile as

86
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:48,182
well. And what was the other one

87
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:54,286
IT? The one with the other
section that we had to do the

88
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:58,609
questions no the other one are
the ideal job. Sorry yeah.

89
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,054
Yeah so. That section of me
it's it's done so.

90
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,890
How did we want some?

91
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,950
Oh was that the?

92
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,642
Was that the research part of it
or where you had to include

93
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:20,096
statistics? Or was that the
other part that you mean? No,

94
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:24,178
not the other one, the other one
just the one this summer. Just

95
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:27,318
like it. Yeah, the summary of
your ideal job, yeah?

96
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:37,776
That's cool. Are
you are doing cloud services?

97
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:42,384
George yeah. Yeah, so anyway
anyone wants to have a look.

98
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:44,064
They have it right there.

99
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,870
Well, nice.

100
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,658
You have to make
sure you put your.

101
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,538
Before we complete everything
left to make sure we put all

102
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:01,730
of our resources in.

103
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,040
What's a call references?

104
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,370
In Brooklyn.

105
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:14,802
In text citations
and all that

106
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:19,076
stuff. Your reference list is at
the Harvard standard.

107
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,998
Can you do?

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,512
Copy and paste those web pages.
I was gonna use the Harvard

109
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:32,024
referencing system at the bottom
after I used citement so it says

110
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:36,160
on the assessment like at the
end, like you specifically have

111
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,416
to use insight like in text

112
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,645
citation. So every time like you

113
00:07:40,645 --> 00:07:44,070
mentioned. Someone else is
research or something you have

114
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,970
to do, like their name and like
the year or an even like

115
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,470
sometimes the page depending on

116
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,279
what it is. I hate that.

117
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,349
I will have lost marks for that
on my assessment one.

118
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,680
'cause I didn't do that.

119
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,182
Yeah, but it is usually only
like 5% of like that part of the

120
00:08:06,182 --> 00:08:10,898
assessment or whatever. So if
you didn't like do it, then you

121
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:15,614
have run the last a couple
marks. But the rest of it

122
00:08:15,614 --> 00:08:20,723
would've been fine. But like I
was like right at the end. Oh,

123
00:08:20,723 --> 00:08:23,081
I'll just quickly do that bit.

124
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,743
Read it. You text item on
whatever you call it. I just got

125
00:08:27,743 --> 00:08:30,306
yeah all of my websites
correlate to that data that I've

126
00:08:30,306 --> 00:08:33,335
put in. So I'm just going to
copy them back to where they

127
00:08:33,335 --> 00:08:35,822
meant to be. After you cite this

128
00:08:35,822 --> 00:08:39,580
for me. Let's

129
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:46,720
go. Um, Shannon,
I think you did yours a few days

130
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,895
ago, didn't you? Your web

131
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,130
technologies? Or am I?

132
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:57,258
Sub Studio. Is that the
one I'm remembered?

133
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,000
Technologies,

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,660
yeah?
What did that sounds pretty if

135
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,440
you know yeah Sunday.

136
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,960
Just before the meeting.

137
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,218
Yeah. Obviously I've been
working on my programming at the

138
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:20,026
moment. I just had a chance to
get back to fixing some of these

139
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:23,018
files back up. You were a bit
ahead of us anyway.

140
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:30,574
Tomorrow.
FedEx relies and fix

141
00:09:30,574 --> 00:09:33,998
it up and report.

142
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,440
Leah.

143
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,640
What about you guys?

144
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:47,266
So sorry.
Your web technology or will you?

145
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:50,321
Working on the idea, yeah.

146
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,757
I uploaded um section, my
section on the personal

147
00:09:54,757 --> 00:09:58,587
information like the team
profile and then the little bit

148
00:09:58,587 --> 00:10:03,566
like George about the ideal jobs
as part of the team profile and

149
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:08,162
I just got a discovery discussed
with Adam which parts of the

150
00:10:08,162 --> 00:10:13,141
project idea he wants me to
write but we just give you those

151
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:16,588
up anything that's less
technical. I can write like

152
00:10:16,588 --> 00:10:18,120
maybe the motivation or

153
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,150
something. How do we go in
studio? Find out whether we

154
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,250
could use Facebook allowed in
their packages. Adam. Oh yeah,

155
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,760
we can take a look at the
privacy settings that they've

156
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,860
set on posts and what apps
they're allowed that they've

157
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,960
authorized on their account.
That's what games they play, and

158
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:45,290
which ones they want to remove.
But we can't make any changes to

159
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:45,700
that.

160
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:53,370
Web. So
we can say it, we can change a

161
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,370
couple of things, nothing major.

162
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,779
And less we write an actual
Facebook app which then they

163
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:04,525
have to approve and goes on to
Facebook and then we can. But we

164
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:08,254
could still just turn around and
go. You've gotta change this,

165
00:11:08,254 --> 00:11:12,661
this and this and this and then
just direct him to some YouTube

166
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:17,068
tutorials on how they do it.
Yeah, it might have to be based

167
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:20,119
on recommendations or like.
Here's where things look like.

168
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:23,509
Now we recommend this if you
would prefer your information

169
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:25,543
not be accessing these people or

170
00:11:25,543 --> 00:11:29,206
body. Which would still

171
00:11:29,206 --> 00:11:32,574
be valuable. So to speak that

172
00:11:32,574 --> 00:11:34,548
yeah. Be pretty cool.

173
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,420
And it could still like. There's
still possibilities for other

174
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,228
apps, although I think they'd
probably be similar, wouldn't

175
00:11:41,228 --> 00:11:46,934
they? Give you access to what
the settings are, but not how to

176
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:51,004
change? Yeah, that's pretty much
Twitter and Facebook. Both do

177
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:54,806
that. Anything Facebook owns,
which is lots of stuff.

178
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,800
And then Google would
probably Google owns a lot of

179
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,428
stuff, so they have similar
settings on across there.

180
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,770
Different things I don't really
have a social media platform

181
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,600
anymore for us to worry about.

182
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,393
No, I think they own social
media platforms. YouTube.

183
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,720
But that's.

184
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:22,530
New line.
Open up your lines Instagram

185
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:29,268
these days. Wonder
who owns

186
00:12:29,268 --> 00:12:32,860
Myspace these

187
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:40,074
days? Yes.
Wasn't it a newspaper

188
00:12:40,074 --> 00:12:45,370
company? Baby, I think the only
question is it is Tom.

189
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:52,438
My sweet. Yeah,
Rupert Murdoch's Newscorp

190
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,475
Fair

191
00:12:55,475 --> 00:13:00,700
enough. 60% of
everything else so.

192
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:06,016
Facebook. You can use Facebook
to sign into Myspace.

193
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,384
I got a link

194
00:13:11,384 --> 00:13:18,366
that data. So we're working
through some stuff and then

195
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:21,501
there's some things just take

196
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:26,580
time. Is there anything new
Daniel that we could talk about?

197
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:32,795
I don't think so. How long is
sort of everybody's happy.

198
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:34,855
They've gotta feel on.

199
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,960
How it's all gonna be completed
I guess like so to let the road

200
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,312
map to completion. Doesn't sound

201
00:13:41,312 --> 00:13:47,486
right. Uh, yeah, covered all
that basis pretty much.

202
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,866
I think everybody's done a
question for interview.

203
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,220
Oh yeah, I've done. Yeah already
supported their originally. Just

204
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,650
ask for a new Xbox.

205
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,995
So

206
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:11,834
your. So
Steve and he said he is

207
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:15,044
available was at Friday night's

208
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:20,770
Australia fun. American top,
which will be Saturday for us.

209
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,990
What time zone?

210
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:28,230
For us time, what we haven't set
because we didn't have the

211
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,520
questions to give him yet so I
can organize that. Now we've all

212
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,780
done our questions. And then
give him a couple of days to sit

213
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,355
on him or something. Yeah, so
you're busy. You're busy this

214
00:14:40,355 --> 00:14:43,930
weekend. Anyway, out of my yeah,
yeah. And I'm free Saturdays.

215
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:51,250
Next weekend, it shouldn't be
a problem, yeah?

216
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,195
Free Saturdays I'll be working,

217
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:57,200
sorry. I don't finish until 6.

218
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,013
It's quite possible like we're
not gonna be, will be there.

219
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,738
Yeah, I'm usually busy on
weekends as well.

220
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,850
But if I know like a like a week
in advance, I could probably.

221
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,340
Make time.

222
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,138
Yep. Happy to do that.

223
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,583
Or to put it into
perspective, the time that

224
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,853
we're going to have to be
out. It's currently Wednesday

225
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:25,142
in the US and it's 4:47 AM.

226
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,864
Yeah, so if we were
in the US.

227
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:41,000
Really washed in the US
is usually Washington State. 12

228
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,746
hours difference. Oh, it's like
17 hours ahead.

229
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,920
Like 17 hours ahead.

230
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:53,950
Behind behind behind
behind us.

231
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,980
Yeah, so I guess you just let
him set the time when we sort of

232
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,572
work around it, or we can get
like a time time block and work

233
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:07,852
around that would suits and
there were eight o'clock there

234
00:16:07,852 --> 00:16:11,668
would be. 4 in the morning.

235
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,366
This is not my actual answer.

236
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:25,270
So I'm. I'm I'm not
sure I'm not able to calculate

237
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:29,470
that. I'm probably I'm working
Sunday morning from 8:00 AM.

238
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:35,208
Alright, anytime before that,
yeah, I'm free.

239
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,906
Like the following Saturday in
like 9 days or whatever, yeah.

240
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:46,570
Yep, cool. Time zones in such
a pain in the ***

241
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:51,955
I can have that can be an app,
you know that it can be a

242
00:16:51,955 --> 00:16:54,468
project. I think there is an F

243
00:16:54,468 --> 00:16:59,870
already really. Yeah, it just
depends how many ads you want.

244
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,338
Oh dear. I did
have a question for you Adam.

245
00:17:07,338 --> 00:17:11,548
Yeah, I honestly did not
comprehend GitHub all too much

246
00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:16,600
like I only enough to make the
basic website that you saw.

247
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,968
Yeah, so I think I think we can

248
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:26,657
ask questions. I think we all
need to upload a little bit too

249
00:17:26,657 --> 00:17:32,900
GitHub. Um? With what you've
worked with, I'm not going to be

250
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,442
able to do anything without a
little bit of support from

251
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:40,350
someone. Because I won't know
what you've written, even if I

252
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,102
look at it, I won't understand

253
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:47,595
it. I don't know how to add an.
I won't know how to not **** it

254
00:17:47,595 --> 00:17:53,028
up. We can do it tutorial at
some point if you lie using

255
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:55,602
teams I can just show you.

256
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,480
Show you how to do it.

257
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,700
Yeah yeah, thank you.

258
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,442
And, um, like whatever whatever
I'm putting out by imagine I'll

259
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:09,628
have it already written up in a
Word document. And I know you

260
00:18:09,628 --> 00:18:13,814
can do. You can add to the
Reaper as you're going. It will

261
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:17,678
just update it and you can. We
can always rollback changes. Or

262
00:18:17,678 --> 00:18:20,898
Daniel can always rollback
changes since he owns the repo.

263
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,972
So if you accidentally delete
anything we can get Daniel to do

264
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:29,412
a rollback and we can get it all
back and just not sure how to

265
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:31,484
add once they get a time, yeah?

266
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:37,654
OK, do you have GitHub pages
installed? I think it did, yeah.

267
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:44,306
Alright, when did you want me to
do show you how to do it or not?

268
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:46,903
Not until I'm a bit further in.

269
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:51,050
The content. No
problem.

270
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,990
We could probably do it on

271
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,281
discord. That sounds painful

272
00:18:57,281 --> 00:19:01,658
with. Unload on asking. Sing it
without the other day. You gotta

273
00:19:01,658 --> 00:19:05,046
change windows and it's like I'm
not gonna show you that.

274
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:10,600
Every talk something new pops
up. You'll change screen share,

275
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,420
yeah. Screen screen.

276
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,874
Show conversation

277
00:19:16,874 --> 00:19:19,980
Rachel and. And.

278
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,724
Going. Traffic to share content

279
00:19:24,724 --> 00:19:29,590
I'm guessing. Oh, there
it is.

280
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,009
I do something.

281
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,180
Girl shuffled now.

282
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,338
And it's not.

283
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,230
'cause I I wrote all of mine
in the space of four hours

284
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,400
with just paragraphs and
headings, paragraphs and

285
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,120
Headings. So other than that,
I have no idea what I'm doing.

286
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:59,390
Set alarm Yeah, I can see
you won't take long. I don't

287
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:03,580
think so. I just figured you
didn't get the chance to draw

288
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,074
last night.

289
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,770
Yes.

290
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:25,430
Reported.

291
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:33,124
2000 E.
Used or Ms teams. Features yeah,

292
00:20:33,124 --> 00:20:38,276
yeah yeah it's important. Plus
in preparation for.

293
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,498
Yeah. I don't know how to get
rid of it.

294
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,358
Oh, there it is.

295
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:49,130
Area. Fun room.

296
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:55,500
So is there anything else we
need to go over?

297
00:20:55,550 --> 00:21:00,035
It didn't. We do need to make a
bit more time.

298
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,100
Just to get to that 25 minutes
so if we've got nothing to talk

299
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,088
about, maybe. So just to
confirm where we're still

300
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:10,972
meeting meeting every
Wednesday, say 3030.

301
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,170
Yep.

302
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:21,056
Don't know. What we
gonna do another another meeting

303
00:21:21,056 --> 00:21:25,636
needed round, round or weekend.
Technically done 2 already from

304
00:21:25,636 --> 00:21:27,926
Sunday. We've done 2 already.

305
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,339
Eating 3. Wait, so we
can possibly wait till

306
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:33,380
next Wednesday now?

307
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:41,158
Will even. When do I
wake up last night?

308
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:46,500
I'm just saying for this week
just scheduled groups organized.

309
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,916
So people are still organizing
groups, so so just do one this

310
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:55,992
week. Yeah, so I don't know when
the count from assuming it is

311
00:21:55,992 --> 00:21:57,030
Sunday to Sunday.

312
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,970
So we done Sunday Wednesday, so
we have fallen for this week.

313
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,330
Thank other groups are about the
same where we're at as well.

314
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,070
Yeah. That's good to know.

315
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,150
Plus, I think they'll, they'll
say, like the progress we're

316
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:17,891
making, or like how far ahead we
are considering other people

317
00:22:17,891 --> 00:22:20,046
haven't got their groups yet,

318
00:22:20,046 --> 00:22:24,250
so. Like if there's nothing to
talk about because we've each

319
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,634
allocated to us, and then we
currently completely number

320
00:22:27,634 --> 00:22:32,786
then. What are they gonna mark
down for yeah.

321
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:38,754
So do we have a goal on what we
should have? We should complete

322
00:22:38,754 --> 00:22:44,489
this week. Like what should be
finished? Yeah, that's a good

323
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:48,500
question. One of the goals can
be locking in the appointment

324
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,582
for interview, so I'll have that

325
00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:55,290
done. And I'll try and get my
report done. I'm about.

326
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,756
Half mostly like over halfway
through at the moment, so I'll

327
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:03,428
try and Polish that by the end
of the week as well.

328
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:08,690
So running reports done by
the end of the week or by

329
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,470
next meeting.

330
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,344
We could do it next meeting,

331
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:17,388
yeah? The next meeting Saturday.

332
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,098
When's Day currently?

333
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:30,330
Um, and that like we can. In
that time we could go over each

334
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,530
other stuff and do some.

335
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,350
Corrections in.

336
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:43,109
What not?
But suppose I could have a team

337
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:48,474
profiles section done. By
Wednesday as well, yeah, most of

338
00:23:48,474 --> 00:23:53,886
the content done for team
profile. Now we just need a

339
00:23:53,886 --> 00:23:58,948
four, yeah? Format as I still
need to post my summarized

340
00:23:58,948 --> 00:24:03,920
profile, but we can do that
tonight or tomorrow morning or

341
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:09,378
something. Did we wanna have the
ideal? The part one of the

342
00:24:09,378 --> 00:24:14,754
ideals job? Ideal job section
done by then as well or leave

343
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:20,130
that till next time? Just it's
just a very small summary of

344
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,162
ideal types, not the not the
research data part.

345
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:29,351
Profile section of. Yeah yeah
yeah yeah that would be cool.

346
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,064
Ideal job go under our
individual profiles. Is

347
00:24:32,064 --> 00:24:34,430
that going under its
own section altogether?

348
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,460
Rules summary part that goes
under the team profile section,

349
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:44,260
which is just just when we
compare our ideal jobs to each

350
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:49,956
other, yeah. So you thinking
Adam, that each of our

351
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:54,948
individual. Summaries go under
our photos like you've already

352
00:24:54,948 --> 00:25:00,129
put those through and then
comparing the jobs would be a

353
00:25:00,129 --> 00:25:04,136
collective page. Yeah, just the
page with that graph where we

354
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:07,260
don't really have to summarize
the jobs too much. I'll just

355
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,100
link back to the profiles for
the different job names.

356
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:15,396
Yeah, cool. Yeah, and then for
the industry data section where

357
00:25:15,396 --> 00:25:20,258
we look at that burning glass
stuff, I think we can just or

358
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:23,624
answer the couple of questions
that are on it.

359
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,624
You just don't do that sort of
separately as well, and then

360
00:25:27,624 --> 00:25:31,608
Chuck it all together. So I
think that's got some like a

361
00:25:31,608 --> 00:25:32,936
personalized question section as

362
00:25:32,936 --> 00:25:39,796
well. Which yeah, I
don't know how much.

363
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,456
I will let's just two minimum.

364
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,438
Well, I got the 100 words.

365
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,750
What did you say Shannon?

366
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,709
For that one was talking
about with the ID.

367
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,615
Industry data. For the audio

368
00:25:57,615 --> 00:26:02,420
jobs. Mine currently sits at 200
words. I don't know whether

369
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:06,272
that's you know like if you had
all six hours together. It's

370
00:26:06,272 --> 00:26:09,803
1200 words for one report.
Plenty for Tim to read. Yeah,

371
00:26:09,803 --> 00:26:11,087
sorry gonna read it.

372
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,425
Yeah, like I've covered covered
everything in a small amount of

373
00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:16,430
Wordage it's not.

374
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:21,335
I mean, I'm sure he knows what
most jobs are. What's what's the

375
00:26:21,335 --> 00:26:23,470
mark for that section? Has a 10%

376
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,310
combined? Then I think
that's just fine.

377
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,978
I think we could all do that.

378
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,419
And then we're gonna add the
graph, which will probably bump

379
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:36,055
it up a bit.

380
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:40,370
Stop Spider Web graph.

381
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,738
I think we do.

382
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:47,592
Everyone has the industry data
we can build that graph from the

383
00:26:47,592 --> 00:26:52,333
industry data into the yeah.
Yeah, ideal job in the profile.

384
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:54,919
That's the way we're doing, yeah

385
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:56,600
yeah. They wanted.

386
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:02,485
A variety of resources, so like
one had to be data one had to be

387
00:27:02,485 --> 00:27:06,918
description in one had to be
like a graph or a photo or

388
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:11,010
something. So getting a bit of
variety would be good. So I

389
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:15,102
think that's covered if we just
keep it simple with the writing.

390
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:23,650
For 10% Mark, I think
we're really focusing on those

391
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:28,069
web technologies.
The project idea.

392
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,756
Yes, I feel bad that I never
actually looked at the website

393
00:27:32,756 --> 00:27:34,387
and just look at the report at

394
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:38,140
the end. General.

395
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,475
A PDF report at the end I just I
don't know. I guess they just

396
00:27:42,475 --> 00:27:45,365
click through the website really
quick and they wouldn't really

397
00:27:45,365 --> 00:27:48,544
be reading anything. Just make
sure all the links work and

398
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:52,590
stuff. I think I think I heard
that they used to only do it

399
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,480
through the web page, but then
people's Web pages wouldn't

400
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,214
work. So the PDF is there.

401
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,660
They've done, yeah.

402
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,520
That's what Tim said about the

403
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:08,231
assignment one. I mean, when I
legit took screenshots of my

404
00:28:08,231 --> 00:28:12,080
website. I just want select all.

405
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,325
I just formatted a little bit so
I didn't look all.

406
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,834
Doesn't know messy and just
submitted that 'cause I was like

407
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:24,510
I'm not rewriting any of No I
did it the other way around and

408
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,514
wrote it all up in there.

409
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,540
On the Class I discord people
were saying all they did was

410
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,280
submit a PDF that basically said
the link to the website. The

411
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:41,020
link to the repo, their name in
their student number, and that's

412
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,180
OK. No content.

413
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:46,792
I mean, you could copy how she
male coding in there just the

414
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:50,120
content there, yeah? Yeah,
well, I just gave him the

415
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,570
URL so it's like OK.

416
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:57,005
No, you definitely needed the
whole script in already, but I

417
00:28:57,005 --> 00:29:01,745
can understand why they thought
it might have been just given a

418
00:29:01,745 --> 00:29:03,720
link and the basic information.

419
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:10,825
No. So are we good for
this week? Were there any other

420
00:29:10,825 --> 00:29:13,220
questions? Just questions
pertaining where that any

421
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,100
questions for Tim tomorrow tell
us any other thing.

422
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,810
Anything? Just the.

423
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:25,570
What Adam said last week, like
whether it's possible. Doable

424
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:29,294
for the. Um, for the next

425
00:29:29,294 --> 00:29:31,846
project, although. Well after

426
00:29:31,846 --> 00:29:36,598
that. Know how to how it had to
be feasible. Algorithm idea, we

427
00:29:36,598 --> 00:29:40,426
can change it between the next
assignment as well. I we asked

428
00:29:40,426 --> 00:29:44,254
Adam the other night Anthony
yeah yeah so it's not set in

429
00:29:44,254 --> 00:29:49,039
stone that we do it that we have
to have the idea now for the

430
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,548
next ones we can just change it
as we go along.

431
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,810
OK. As long as
far.

432
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,638
Wait, what? Bots teams?

433
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:08,747
Set the Polish guy. No, honestly
wouldn't know how to say that I

434
00:30:08,747 --> 00:30:12,744
like. Yes, we have to make this

435
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:16,872
thing. I think it's finished all
the modules already. I think he

436
00:30:16,872 --> 00:30:20,414
finished them three days into
the course 'cause you know Bart

437
00:30:20,414 --> 00:30:24,278
stuff. Of course before. Yeah,
that's what I read in one of

438
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:28,142
these things. He's done of
course, but then had to drop out

439
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:32,328
at the end, so he's already done
it like it was cherry picking

440
00:30:32,328 --> 00:30:34,260
his team members there was like.

441
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,189
'cause I was looking through
week three stuff in week four

442
00:30:39,189 --> 00:30:44,018
and seeing that he'd answered It
on the 30th of August.

443
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,350
Incidental waiting for the
day we started the course.

444
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:50,680
Yeah, have you guys seen
that movie about whether

445
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,160
the interns at Google?

446
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,384
Oh, is it the fence? The yeah
yeah yeah that one you know that

447
00:30:59,384 --> 00:31:04,136
guy that made at the first day
that's going around picking the

448
00:31:04,136 --> 00:31:06,512
best team members in his ****

449
00:31:06,512 --> 00:31:13,886
**** Impression that I get
from bottom like that guy.

450
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:20,481
It is going OK. Maybe should
be should stop recording this.

451
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,550
Either way.

452
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:29,838
Sure.
She's sharing next meeting.

453
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,060
I guess I can share next

454
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,672
meeting. All on Wednesday, so if
there's another meeting before

455
00:31:37,672 --> 00:31:40,804
then, I probably won't be
prepared for that, but.

456
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,592
Next week next Wednesday, I can

457
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:48,118
share. Cool and recording
that yes, lovely.
