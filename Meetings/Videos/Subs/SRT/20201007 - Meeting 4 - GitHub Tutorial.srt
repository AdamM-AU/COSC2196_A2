1
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:05,850
Yeah, cool.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,348
So whatever is everybody, using
on issuing the Atom.

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:13,940
No.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,448
I don't know whatever I'm using.

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,090
But it's not Adam.

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,070
So.

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,034
Plus plus notepad++, yeah, I
might have that.

8
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:29,190
Yeah.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,200
I figure so I think the
course they recommended using

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,960
the Atom editor anyway.

11
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,310
How? I think Tim dude, so I'm
just I'm gonna do the tutorial

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,430
with that. It's pretty. It's
going to be pretty much the same

13
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,550
as notepad++ it since this is
going to open up a different

14
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,590
program to edit it.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,540
I thought just download that.
Now I'm gonna download Adam

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,428
right now 'cause otherwise I'm
not going to get it. Yeah, so

17
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,048
it's just Adam dot IO.

18
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,080
So, like holier.

19
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,520
What do you know again?

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,040
There's a fine game where you
control the whole of life.

21
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,000
And it chewed up buildings.

22
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,160
Go on.

23
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,060
How?

24
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,090
Yeah, I'm downloading now.

25
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,988
Daniel, see this marvelous
lighting screen.

26
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,280
Everyone can see my screen OK.

27
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,424
Ah, it looks very
pixelated for me.

28
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,600
Open.

29
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,417
Yeah is it flipped
around why? Yeah.

30
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,143
I was trying to figure out
what that was.

31
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,310
Sorry, uh, translator.

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,840
Well, it's backwards. On one of
my screens, but then teams is

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,400
telling me it's the right way.

34
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,546
So is that better? Yeah, that's
it. Yeah, get out. Yeah that's

35
00:02:22,546 --> 00:02:26,983
it, yeah. I'll just wait is
download Adam. I'll just be

36
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:27,657
one second.

37
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,970
It's pretty clear to.

38
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,458
I do recommend the game Collier.

39
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,384
So I just arguing with the kids
about cleaning the land room.

40
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,722
Search pixelated or did you want
me to change the mode?

41
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,297
Adams window, it'll come up
bigger if you haven't done that

42
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:08,322
already. Yeah, looks like
really nice and clear on

43
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:09,778
mine. Yeah mine OK.

44
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,742
I might be my connection then,

45
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:15,220
yeah. Because I can't
really see much.

46
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,350
Probably double click on my

47
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,990
picture. That help.

48
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,068
Ah yeah, that's better.

49
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,606
Just got worse, just got worse.

50
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,130
And it's better now.

51
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,795
Yes, it's it's fluctuated it's

52
00:03:36,795 --> 00:03:38,310
fluctuated. App.

53
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,145
OK, in the recording,
Yeah Alright so.

54
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,680
I've got like 2 two mice
going at the moment.

55
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,838
Do I need to open a record?

56
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,200
What was that?

57
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,048
Click to open report
on my following along.

58
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,100
Uh, no. I'm just checking
where everything is.

59
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,098
Taking the 'cause you did both.

60
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,370
Night invite.

61
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,250
Alright, so I'm assuming you've
all got GitHub Desktop.

62
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,350
Yeah, maybe. Yeah, how
do I tell?

63
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,155
Yeah. Yeah you should. You
go to start.

64
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,040
Yeah.

65
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,200
If I lose 300 G.

66
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,232
Do I need to open it GitHub Inc
and they should be GitHub

67
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:41,698
desktop installed as well,
'cause there's two ways I'm

68
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,534
going to show you how to do
this. So what was helping? Do I

69
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:47,178
need to look that up too?

70
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,169
My start bar was covering
your direction.

71
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,678
Let's start and then under
the letter. G you should see

72
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:59,736
GitHub Inc. And then they are
under that should be adamant

73
00:04:59,736 --> 00:05:00,570
in GitHub Desktop.

74
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,350
Huh.

75
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,118
What is target up?

76
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:08,730
Keep.

77
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,100
James

78
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,863
uh never look at my
computer in this way.

79
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,210
No.

80
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,383
So what's the difference between
using notepad++ an Atom?

81
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,392
Adams gotta like a sidebar fee
for the Git Management so you

82
00:05:30,392 --> 00:05:34,748
can just click the files and
open them from there where

83
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:36,332
notepad++ you would open.

84
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:43,482
GitHub desktop like this and you
need to click open in notepad++

85
00:05:43,482 --> 00:05:45,406
or show in Explorer.

86
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,890
Which will then yeah.

87
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,040
Show you the files there.

88
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,716
And my Rockstar again so far.

89
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,018
I have get home, you've got it.

90
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,782
Alright so first we were going
to do the Adam way so we're just

91
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:10,898
going to click. Where do I click
version control with Git and

92
00:06:10,898 --> 00:06:15,014
GitHub so you just click on
that, so opens here. Then you

93
00:06:15,014 --> 00:06:16,729
go? Open the git panel.

94
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,799
My phone yes.

95
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,970
But how did you open that? You
you did things before you OK?

96
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,559
This screen here.

97
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,220
Get.

98
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,119
Text editor for the
21st century window.

99
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,586
Ah, yes, I finally do Yep.

100
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,610
And now it says get to know
Adam. So then you'll see version

101
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,580
control with Git and GitHub.
Have a quick there.

102
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,246
Then we could open get panel.

103
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,240
Yep.

104
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,606
Within Gonna Just go
across to GitHub.

105
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,070
Appear.

106
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,960
Trip.

107
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,598
I need a screen.

108
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:05,769
What was that?

109
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,230
Sorry, I thought you clicked
something, I'm confused.

110
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,210
What are you clicking next?

111
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,360
Published.

112
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,232
So see how on my window,
I've got this.

113
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,795
Oh, I had I had a recorded
message over that. No, I cannot

114
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:30,770
see that. Actually, it's rocked.

115
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,119
Yeah yeah, yeah.

116
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,478
Yep, and then we will go coin an
existing GitHub repository.

117
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,768
Now they changed it.

118
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:51,784
So we need the git repo 'cause,
it's not letting it's not.

119
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,770
Smoke.

120
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,580
I don't know why use this
one, so just bear with me.

121
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,810
Come now.

122
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,208
That's what is calling.

123
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,370
Directory.

124
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,010
I'm pretty sure this
is meant to sign in.

125
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:25,306
Daniel, do is add a middle. Yeah
I used items for my first

126
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:28,744
project. Does it isn't an
ornament automatically meant to

127
00:08:28,744 --> 00:08:30,654
let you sign into GitHub.

128
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:31,700
When?

129
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,794
Yeah, when I opened at him
just before I was still set

130
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:37,029
up for my old one.

131
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,938
I can't I can? I can barely even
remember how actually set it up.

132
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:47,134
Right right now, I've got, I'm
using GitHub Desktop.

133
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,000
And I've got a clone of the.

134
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,987
The Master Branch, and that's
what I've been using to upload

135
00:08:53,987 --> 00:08:57,551
files to GitHub. I think I'm
just going to scratch the Adam

136
00:08:57,551 --> 00:09:00,818
bit. I'll get back to the
batches on that one, apologies.

137
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,569
So we're just gonna go
GitHub Desktop.

138
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,164
The easiest way without using
that other thing.

139
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,724
Let me know when you get
it open.

140
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,794
And if you signed indicated
desktop, yeah, yeah, I got it

141
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:20,678
open now have you signed into

142
00:09:20,678 --> 00:09:23,730
yours yet? Maddie. Ah.

143
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,163
So it's probably gonna give you
a login screen.

144
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,630
Yeah, I think it looks like it.

145
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,840
So you should be able to click
here current repository.

146
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,640
Oh, mine says current repository
says Daniel's coffee GitHub. Is

147
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,670
that the one that we're working
on is CEO S?

148
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,028
Yes yes yes.

149
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,546
Do you have that on
yours? Yeah, it says.

150
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,434
I. No, I don't know what
you're talking about.

151
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,370
So are you able to share
your screen with me.

152
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,690
2nd.

153
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,826
I say if you click
on metal and pre.

154
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,220
And then click close ad.

155
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,460
Clone.

156
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,378
And we're going to click Daniel.

157
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,208
I'm gonna get coin?

158
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,129
It's gonna pull down
the Master Branch.

159
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,379
She I don't know if I keep that
in mind is already there.

160
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,955
Did you do it on the website

161
00:11:00,955 --> 00:11:04,100
perhaps? Follow the git repo.

162
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,540
I probably bought Daniel right

163
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,142
now. Sorry, but probably
boring you right now. This is

164
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:21,420
good. I need a refresher.
Anyway, I never I don't really

165
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,294
know what I did to make it
work. I just sort of winged

166
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:29,168
it. So now if you click the
Daniels repo there there a 2.

167
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,736
Alright and then we can go we
can get open and Adam or we

168
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:36,255
can go show in Explorer. We're
going to show in Explorer.

169
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,622
Can we click on that now? You
know what games I play?

170
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:49,038
Oh wait, I see that window.
We only see you get ready

171
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:52,822
for the right. Give me a
second, I will do it.

172
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,060
I have a.

173
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,747
Mine is like came out with
like a pity. A text file says

174
00:12:01,747 --> 00:12:05,916
get so say attributes. Yeah,
just one moment I'll swap to

175
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,432
the master branch online.

176
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,966
And I'll be able to show you.

177
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,330
Show in Explorer. It should look

178
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:22,308
like this. Yeah, industry data,
IT technologies, IT work meeting

179
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:26,756
teams profiles web support files
and Readme MD.

180
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,456
Is everybody say that on this
great? Yes Yep now for example,

181
00:12:32,456 --> 00:12:36,436
if you've got a document that
you just want to.

182
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,500
Add to the repo. Now like I said
like here, I've got the

183
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,400
Mongoose. I'm just going to copy
these to the source is just the

184
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,625
source for The Monkees far and
drop drop that like I was adding

185
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,250
a file to a USB.

186
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,110
Straight into the folder.

187
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,360
Then I'll go back to GitHub
Desktop and it's Gonna tell me

188
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,130
here that I've got two changed

189
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,976
files. One Mongoose which is
adding 'cause there's a plus

190
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:07,864
and sources and then, uh, right
here I've gotta for every time

191
00:13:07,864 --> 00:13:11,428
you commit something back to
the any of the branches you've

192
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:14,992
gotta give it a summary and
less. It's just an individual

193
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:18,880
file change. So in this one I'm
just going to say long

194
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,204
Mongoose.

195
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,376
Image and give it a descripcion.

196
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,778
You don't have. The
descriptions are optional.

197
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,515
So are you adding
this image too?

198
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,940
So you could draw on that later
and add it to the website.

199
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,626
Ah yeah, anybody can grab it.
'cause once I commit this, but

200
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:52,825
it will commit it. I'm going to
push to origin, which means push

201
00:13:52,825 --> 00:13:54,763
it back to the GitHub Server.

202
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,390
So sending it out to the cloud
if you want to call it that.

203
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,916
Now if you guys open up this

204
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,300
window again. And select.

205
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,798
And just click on fetch origin.

206
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,640
What up

207
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,129
hello right here?

208
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,070
Yeah, click on that.

209
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,338
Yep, that's The One.

210
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:32,890
Alright.

211
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,220
K.

212
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,140
Yes.

213
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,470
Or are they?

214
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,770
OK, now show in Explorer.

215
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:00,274
And then if you go to the
web support file web support

216
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:04,861
files folder. You'll see in
there that there is now 1

217
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:06,946
goose and the sources text.

218
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,478
Then I moved over just before.

219
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,480
OK.

220
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:20,927
So how how do we add to
the website?

221
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:26,102
Now to add to the website,
that's just one branch, so this

222
00:15:26,102 --> 00:15:28,662
is where all your support
documents like your your word

223
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:31,478
documents and everything go. As
you make changes, even even if

224
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:34,038
they're not finished, they
should go in the Master Branch.

225
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,210
OK, and then just every time you
edit him, edit him out of.

226
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,830
The location in Shell Explorer.

227
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,270
OK. Yeah.

228
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,826
That way, that way you get these
commit history to say that

229
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,366
you've been committing to the

230
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:55,322
repo. So like I can see here

231
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:59,770
that Daniel. Updated industry
data in the Doc. Sam uploaded

232
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,970
it. Re uploaded these
blockchain. I uploaded some

233
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,970
JavaScript files Shannon created
some new file folders and added

234
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,370
some questions and I could see
the changes that we made.

235
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,220
So there's a history of that.

236
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,896
If you click on history
tab here.

237
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:24,512
Yeah, yeah. So for example, Adam
if I wanna update if I want to

238
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:29,985
upload my my industry data. You
know like my whatever I have in

239
00:16:29,985 --> 00:16:31,248
Microsoft Exchange Yep.

240
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,490
I do this and I have load my.

241
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,039
I got my Word document into
GitHub. Yeah, like.

242
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,528
Search the branch or the the.

243
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,178
How how do you What Car?

244
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,880
How did you add?

245
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,086
How you added all of that?

246
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,298
Added to the replay.

247
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,440
Current repository.

248
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,360
Cyclic.

249
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,320
Current repository.

250
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,270
Car repository.

251
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,060
Well, we've already done that.
Heavenly, we've done that. Now

252
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,252
if we want to change just to
the website, see over here

253
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:21,582
where it says current branch.

254
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,426
Yeah yeah, if you click on
that it's gonna bring it this

255
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:31,706
dropdown menu and then you'll
see under there the website

256
00:17:31,706 --> 00:17:35,314
branch. It may not be under
recent branches, but it'll be

257
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:35,642
website.

258
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,750
Faster, yeah?

259
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,288
And then click website.

260
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,610
Yeah, and it's Gonna reload.

261
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,080
I'll click fetch from origin.

262
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,895
And let me know when
that's done.

263
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,702
Hey could only be working or
just do a a little side

264
00:18:05,702 --> 00:18:08,518
note. You can only be in one
branch at a time.

265
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,148
Understand the branches.

266
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,790
So branches you'll have your
master branch, which is your

267
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,542
main app that you normally
developing.

268
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,658
And then you would have
branches with different

269
00:18:24,658 --> 00:18:27,268
features, which are all gonna
get merged into the master

270
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:27,529
later.

271
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,924
And then you build one
source tray again.

272
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,443
So it's it's. It's basically
branches or aid when you've got

273
00:18:38,443 --> 00:18:42,273
like 3040 developers working on
one application that you're not

274
00:18:42,273 --> 00:18:43,805
tripping over each other.

275
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,908
Yeah, I get that.

276
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:52,290
Just start say how I'm
supposed to know where the

277
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,986
branches are what they do
or who put them there or I

278
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:58,450
don't see it like when
they're talking about

279
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,838
branches. I'm like OK, so
I'll see a tree at some

280
00:19:01,838 --> 00:19:03,070
point but no no.

281
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,967
They kind of refer it to a
branch is only because you know

282
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:14,853
if you were to put it down on
paper, how the system worked. It

283
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,994
would look like branch tree
branch. Yeah, so how?

284
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,740
So when I when I was making
my website, I opened up

285
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,440
GitHub in the browser.

286
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:33,460
And I typed in one big page of
Code Yep and then I committed it

287
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:37,996
alright so other than that I
have no idea what's going on?

288
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,024
That's all I did, so when when I
want to put text somewhere on

289
00:19:44,024 --> 00:19:49,008
the website, how do I so I've
got some text I wanna add to

290
00:19:49,008 --> 00:19:53,280
website can I? So you've got the
website branch now slot selected

291
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,416
like mine in your GitHub Desktop

292
00:19:55,416 --> 00:20:00,028
app. Ah hold on I'll mirror what
I'm doing so I won't be.

293
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,327
I see your window, so if you
could just point to point things

294
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:08,155
on my window. I'm I know I think
I can point on.

295
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:09,820
Hello.

296
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,886
Point with your words, I mean?

297
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,330
Alright, so you've got website.
Can you click fetched origin?

298
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,283
And this is pulling down
the entire website off

299
00:20:25,283 --> 00:20:28,660
the Reaper. OK, so now if
you go show in Explorer.

300
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,686
And then I just need to see
that window, but you should

301
00:20:36,686 --> 00:20:39,416
see a whole heap of files in
there. Yes, sorry.

302
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:42,490
I got it.

303
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,410
Yep, so that's all the code
for the for the website now

304
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:53,960
do you have an idea on? What
kind of section you wanted to

305
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,410
edit say? Let's say your
autonomous vehicles?

306
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,070
That is an example.

307
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,466
So if you go to daughter in
this case because it can

308
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:08,524
change depending on how you
design your your web page now.

309
00:21:08,524 --> 00:21:10,192
If we go to IT technologies.

310
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,621
Alright, so in there will
see the first one

311
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:16,319
autonomous vehicles.

312
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,512
I probably didn't want to
double click. You probably

313
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:23,576
want to right click and then
select edit.

314
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,036
I'll, I'll how do you want to?

315
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,234
OK for Google and then
I'll exit that.

316
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,969
So we'll go right, click
open edit with notepad++

317
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:39,613
that would be perfect.

318
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,350
At next, see autonomous vehicles
tab in industry data. That's

319
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:53,606
that whole bit of code where you
can just put that information.

320
00:21:53,606 --> 00:22:00,176
Can you see what I'm what? I can
only see you. I take, yeah, OK.

321
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,770
Is it a space the team
version of desktop sharing

322
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,890
is not that good?

323
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,264
Just select no for now, you
don't want to update it so.

324
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:17,400
I've got some JavaScript,
which is going to fetch this

325
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,564
and then merge it into the
rest of the site as you're

326
00:22:21,564 --> 00:22:26,075
loading it so but this section
is all yours to work in for

327
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:27,116
the autonomous vehicles.

328
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,800
There is a very trick to the
formatting of this HTML.

329
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,138
I can come along later and tidy
it up so you can just put it out

330
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:38,596
in however you want at this

331
00:22:38,596 --> 00:22:45,452
stage. So can can I just put it
in as at all. I need to do is

332
00:22:45,452 --> 00:22:46,920
separate my paragraphs otherwise

333
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,860
paste text? Yeah.

334
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,274
'cause I've already got is that
how you doing, or what? How do

335
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:59,006
you do it? Uh, well I'm assuming
is written it in Word, so HTML

336
00:22:59,006 --> 00:23:00,164
formatted at all.

337
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,209
To copy and paste and then add
the HTML around it.

338
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:12,590
Yeah, so do I so if it if it's
just paragraphs do? I need to

339
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:16,594
just put paragraph splits. And
that's it. Yeah, if you wanna.

340
00:23:16,594 --> 00:23:20,598
Just do paragraph splits. If
you go back to that. Explorer

341
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:24,602
window if you just want to
open up the cybersecurity. One

342
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:28,242
you can see how I wrote wrote
up Shannons for.

343
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,912
So we'll just we can just go to

344
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:36,661
the other. To the other to
the other ones and just

345
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:39,172
look how it is structured.
Left clicking by looking.

346
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,490
I think it's clicking off the
icon before you get to.

347
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:44,710
Yeah.

348
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,589
There we go.

349
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:55,972
Yeah, yeah that structure right?
Yeah, so I've got classes here,

350
00:23:55,972 --> 00:24:01,276
were like PT-2. Well that's the
Petes short for padding top and

351
00:24:01,276 --> 00:24:06,580
I'm telling you put 2 units of
padding. PB-3 is saying it

352
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,000
padding bottom with three units,
but it doesn't really matter

353
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,862
because I can come along and
just tidy it up later.

354
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:23,510
Um H5 I'm using as a general
heading H Forza Page Title H 6

355
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,390
is like a subtitle.

356
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,280
OK.

357
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,450
Yeah, I'm

358
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,248
so really difficult.

359
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,380
Pretty much so far I've just
been taking everybody's word

360
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,776
documents and then doing this
for years and then you can go

361
00:24:42,776 --> 00:24:45,606
along and just edit any section
that you want afterwards.

362
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,480
Oh 610. Sorry and then if we
screw up at some point.

363
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,045
We won't be like,
uh, what can I say?

364
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,660
Damage in the whole website no
no OK 'cause that was one of my

365
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,690
concerns like I don't wanna go
in touch any of that because I

366
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:09,410
don't wanna you know like delete
something and then so you can

367
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:13,130
edit the individual files are
due back, it up every every two

368
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,850
days or every day, I've got
rolling copies of the work that

369
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,880
I've been submitting to it, so
as not a big problem. If someone

370
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,290
was to accidentally delete it.
'cause I could just re upload

371
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,700
it. It would probably would lose
minimal. But if you're only

372
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,940
editing like your individual

373
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,420
sections. Like in this case, IIT
autonomous vehicles dot HTML and

374
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,501
you accidentally delete that?
Well then it's not a major thing

375
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:40,469
because we still got the
original Word document.

376
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,240
To bring back that far.

377
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,960
Sorry. I I can you tell me
again what PT true is?

378
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,848
What 2 units?

379
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,416
Sorry, I need to go now. Yeah
that's alright. OK bye but

380
00:25:57,416 --> 00:25:58,430
anyways thank you.

381
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,426
So PT-2 is just a style class
that I added to want to make.

382
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,110
From aligning everything
easier for me.

383
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,108
You don't have to put that you
could just put paragraphs and

384
00:26:14,108 --> 00:26:17,524
then if you'd like I can come
along and do it if you don't

385
00:26:17,524 --> 00:26:18,988
think you're gonna be able to.

386
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,540
Do that is.

387
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,218
That what you want.

388
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,539
I I want.

389
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:33,032
I want to do it myself, but
I'm thinking that might take

390
00:26:33,032 --> 00:26:37,592
too long. I'll give you a
rundown of basically the

391
00:26:37,592 --> 00:26:39,872
easiest way. I use PT-2.

392
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,288
For paragraphs that belong to
the same heading. So if you say

393
00:26:45,288 --> 00:26:47,591
H5 there at the top, what does

394
00:26:47,591 --> 00:26:49,550
it do? That

395
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:56,800
I didn't say they are all well
old pay 2. Up until the last one

396
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,092
which becomes P PT-2 an padding

397
00:26:59,092 --> 00:27:03,750
bottom 3. Yeah, Yep, that means
that I'm going to Ave heading

398
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,278
after that. So as you can see
I've got data loss prevention.

399
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,380
And then say the next client
that that's the only one of that

400
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,980
paragraph. There's no paragraphs
to follow that heading, so it's

401
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,100
only got padding on the bottom
by three units, and I've done

402
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,400
that all the way through.

403
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:27,328
If you if you don't get it
right, it's not a big deal

404
00:27:27,328 --> 00:27:31,956
'cause we can always fix it up
later, and I can always guide

405
00:27:31,956 --> 00:27:35,872
you through what you needed to
change. Yeah, I still really

406
00:27:35,872 --> 00:27:39,432
don't comprehend. Yes yeah, so
it's more complicated HTML and

407
00:27:39,432 --> 00:27:43,704
CSS that we didn't really. They
didn't really want to teach in

408
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:48,688
this unit. Yeah yeah, OK. So if
you want you can just put basic

409
00:27:48,688 --> 00:27:50,824
HTML like you did for your

410
00:27:50,824 --> 00:27:54,840
normal page. And then I can
just go through and add that

411
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,202
if I think it's needed anyway.

412
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:02,892
OK, so I'll just do my open,
do the open paragraph bit

413
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:06,540
and the close paragraph bit.
Yeah and then.

414
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:13,074
Some ultra some headings, but
I'll probably get that wrong and

415
00:28:13,074 --> 00:28:14,970
it do do do.

416
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:20,826
So it will be easier for you to
read if I have it all in one

417
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:22,030
straight line like this.

418
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:29,016
Ah. Yes or no. I just indent
that way to make it easier

419
00:28:29,016 --> 00:28:32,046
for other people to read so
it doesn't really doesn't

420
00:28:32,046 --> 00:28:35,076
really phase me. It just
makes it look tidy overall.

421
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:36,710
Yeah.

422
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,750
I'm OK.

423
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:46,044
I just finished comprehend
did more so I was able to

424
00:28:46,044 --> 00:28:47,286
contribute more because.

425
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:54,065
Like I can I can write **** on a
Word document and go on forever,

426
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,422
yeah, and answer all the
questions in double triple

427
00:28:57,422 --> 00:29:00,779
detail but currently I don't
comprehend this just yet.

428
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,209
Get it with.

429
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,395
Yeah, did you teach yourself

430
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:10,466
this? This yeah, I
was self taught.

431
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:17,194
I remember writing writing
crappy web pages when I was a

432
00:29:17,194 --> 00:29:20,434
lot younger, with like a
little icons that used to

433
00:29:20,434 --> 00:29:24,322
follow your mouse around the
screen or like a big chain of

434
00:29:24,322 --> 00:29:27,562
my little bouncy balls. It
would waive around with it,

435
00:29:27,562 --> 00:29:28,858
and that's awesome, yeah?

436
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,430
Well, I think.

437
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,154
I just just wanna get rid of
this and go back to how to

438
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:40,859
upload mine one more time.

439
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,380
Want to?

440
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,880
If I want to add to add
to this one.

441
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,680
How do I do that?

442
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,638
How to re edit?

443
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:57,690
Yep.

444
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,740
I. Then then I talked in
that the pop up window,

445
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,128
they can't say yeah.

446
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,260
So they make it change, right?

447
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,592
So just just make any change
on it. So say Maddie was

448
00:30:14,592 --> 00:30:16,640
here or whatever you like in
that document.

449
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,140
That you've opened.

450
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,855
You can't see what I'm
doing. Can you know?

451
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,400
Change this line like that.

452
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,519
This one. That wasn't it?

453
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:36,778
So we got.

454
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:43,808
Notepad game the corner. Yeah we
gotta not gone.

455
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:48,100
Sorry I I'm trying to find where
I put it.

456
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,010
I can't see my own.

457
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,030
I see.

458
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,280
Yep, that's it.

459
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:08,758
And then we're gonna just hit
save the little floppy disk that

460
00:31:08,758 --> 00:31:13,006
one, Yep, now if we swap back to
the GitHub desktop window.

461
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,428
Now that you've saved that every
time you make a change and you

462
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:21,980
done for whatever time frame
that you were going to work on

463
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,828
it, you save it. Then you go
back to the GitHub Desktop app.

464
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,439
This one, I see. Now it's saying
that it's picked up or change

465
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:34,121
and it's a It's got the red. The
line, it's taking away and then

466
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:37,277
the green is the line. It's
putting in which was Maddie was

467
00:31:37,277 --> 00:31:40,950
here. So because it's only one
file you've edited, you don't

468
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:45,238
have to put in a summary at the
top, so we can just say we could

469
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:46,846
add a description, or we can

470
00:31:46,846 --> 00:31:50,258
just click commit. To
website Yep.

471
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,391
So we've committed that now and
then. The next step we gotta do

472
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:59,382
is we gotta go push to origin.
So This Is everybody else can

473
00:31:59,382 --> 00:32:00,610
pick up the change.

474
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:06,010
OK, so when when I'm committing
it, why isn't that that like

475
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:09,805
what is the commit do that's
different to the push? Alright

476
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:13,945
So so, for example, you were
going to edit like 10 different

477
00:32:13,945 --> 00:32:17,395
files in one hit. You can do
individual descriptions and

478
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:21,880
summaries for each file or each
group of files for the task that

479
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,915
you were doing.

480
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:29,060
Right and then you can then you
don't have to push him to the

481
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:32,480
the repo until you're ready. So
you can say. I've done 10

482
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,185
commits. These are all the notes
and the commits of what I did,

483
00:32:36,185 --> 00:32:40,175
and then why now that I've done
put all those notes in and I'm

484
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:43,880
done for the night. Now I'm
going to push it back to the

485
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,585
repro for somebody else to grab
OK that does help me a lot

486
00:32:47,585 --> 00:32:51,005
because I was like? Why are you
committing once and then pushing

487
00:32:51,005 --> 00:32:54,140
like you're committing twice?
Yeah, OK OK cool. I think I've?

488
00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:01,250
So now if I was to go to GitHub.
We can go to should be able to

489
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,210
go to Daniels the website. Now
it should actually be live.

490
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,320
Love it.

491
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:17,570
I'm gonna go to IT technologies.
I'm gonna get autonomous

492
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,112
vehicles and look.

493
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,476
This is data blah blah blah.
Matty was here. OK cool it's

494
00:33:24,476 --> 00:33:25,988
already on the site.

495
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:30,892
Thank you for that. I that's
plenty for me. For now I think.

496
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:37,745
If you get stuck general near
a computer most of the day an

497
00:33:37,745 --> 00:33:38,900
can normally respond.

498
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,994
It seems that says I'm online
and I haven't responded. It's

499
00:33:44,994 --> 00:33:49,076
because I can't really respond,
but I will as soon as I can.

500
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,899
Alright, you're not obliged to
respond immediately. I certainly

501
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:57,917
don't. Yeah, I I tried to but
then there's this times when

502
00:33:57,917 --> 00:34:00,881
you like you got a customer
there and you're just like I

503
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:02,857
can't really just open this
up right now.

504
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,182
Oh, thank you so much for that,

505
00:34:07,182 --> 00:34:10,678
that's that's great. Yeah, I
hope that was helpful, but.

506
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,110
Kid.

507
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,136
I I didn't say her in
the cameras.

508
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:24,850
She started it.

509
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,727
They keep sneaking in here
and stealing all my

510
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:29,293
permanent markers.

511
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:35,450
Yeah, that's dangerous, yeah,
and then I find like a warm or

512
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,620
something colored in.

513
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,225
Magic eraser becomes like your

514
00:34:39,225 --> 00:34:43,482
best friend. Does it work for
the permanent? Yeah

515
00:34:43,482 --> 00:34:46,170
surprisingly. But there's
only so many times you can

516
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,170
use it on a wall before the
paint comes off.

517
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,750
Say yeah.

518
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,440
Do you have questions?

519
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:59,836
I'm pretty good, I've just been
doing what you guys been

520
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:02,982
talking about on the on my
industry data section. Now I'm

521
00:35:02,982 --> 00:35:06,414
just I'm just doing the changes
in GitHub and sort of copying

522
00:35:06,414 --> 00:35:08,988
some of the formatting of
Shannons industry data section.

523
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,470
Just wanna say hi there we go.

524
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,240
Set alarm

525
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,792
like where the reason why dad
has to leave the camera. So

526
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:25,052
many times because once dads
on the camera. There's nobody

527
00:35:25,052 --> 00:35:25,704
watching them.

528
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,220
So we I get after all
kinds of dodgy stuff.

529
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,010
Alright, I'll end
the recording here.

530
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,508
These are very mischievous.
