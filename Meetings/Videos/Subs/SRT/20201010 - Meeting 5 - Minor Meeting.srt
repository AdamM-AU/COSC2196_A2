1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,166
So I mean research the rest.

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:13,147
So after a quick idea is that
for both Android and iOS, that

3
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:17,188
will evaluate a individuals
privacy settings that they have

4
00:00:17,188 --> 00:00:21,229
on their various social media
accounts, be it Instagram,

5
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:26,168
Facebook, Twitter, we chat. Or
we can always expand add more

6
00:00:26,168 --> 00:00:31,556
later Ascential E the user is
going to give us permission to

7
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:35,597
access their social media
accounts with their details to

8
00:00:35,597 --> 00:00:38,291
which we will then check their

9
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:41,550
privacy settings. For example,
like on Facebook there post

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,850
public, are there Pictures
public that don't need to be

11
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,490
besides their profile pictures
and then will make

12
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,790
recommendations based on what we
found? We can't actually change

13
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,410
this. A lot of the settings for
them, so the idea is that will

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,030
say hey, this is bad. This is
bad. This is bad and here are

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,320
some videos that we can link you
to on that we've created on

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,950
YouTube with a step by step
tutorial showing them how to

17
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,250
resolve those security issues.
So basically it's going to just

18
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,476
do a. Security and privacy
checkup. Yeah cool I mean Yeah

19
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:21,516
it also push them notifications
and push them notifications if

20
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:25,548
their privacy agreements with
the social media platforms

21
00:01:25,548 --> 00:01:29,134
change. So like Facebook forever
changing their privacy settings

22
00:01:29,134 --> 00:01:33,446
and making it harder to turn off
some things and easy to turn off

23
00:01:33,446 --> 00:01:36,834
others. So when that happens or
they've changed it, so saying

24
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:39,914
that, well, we're going to share
your information with this

25
00:01:39,914 --> 00:01:42,070
company. Now we need to buy the

26
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,320
user of that. Cool, I get to
yeah. Do they update those terms

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,620
and agreements just all the time
in the background and just don't

28
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,645
tell anyone where they normally
give you like this little Gray

29
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:56,220
message bar up in the top. Do
it. My lot of people when

30
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,970
they're signing in. Just click
dismiss. Yeah, well, you just

31
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,270
get that notification and you're
like oh that's not one of my

32
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,295
friends whatever and in there
it's like oh we're gonna tell

33
00:02:05,295 --> 00:02:09,145
everybody that you own a house
or if you agree to this we own

34
00:02:09,145 --> 00:02:12,720
10% of your house 'cause nobody
reads the yoga so we gotta make

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,370
sure it like we check those.

36
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,188
And maybe say hi, you might not
like this anymore because they

37
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:20,700
are, they're giving your
information to these people.

38
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,782
Yeah, yeah, because if you still
need to use the app, you just

39
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:28,864
have to accept it you. But yeah,
most people would just after you

40
00:02:28,864 --> 00:02:32,946
want 10% of my house. Fine you
wanna use my text phone number?

41
00:02:32,946 --> 00:02:37,656
That's OK you got me in a corner
here. Yeah I still need to talk

42
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:41,424
to those people in those cat
means I just can't live without.

43
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:47,200
Yes. Sorry,
you're happy too.

44
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,808
Drop a graph, a draft of what
you think that might look like.

45
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:57,826
Daniel and then share it with
Adam. I'll try and have a draft

46
00:02:57,826 --> 00:03:03,230
done by our next meeting, so
then we'll be able to do that in

47
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:08,248
the last 30 minutes, like 4 days
to get it all over scratch

48
00:03:08,248 --> 00:03:12,494
because we've got a fairly
simple project idea which we can

49
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:16,354
really hash out pretty quickly
on for the project plans.

50
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,903
Yeah. Discover

51
00:03:19,903 --> 00:03:26,962
type yeah. And I'll be
available next Saturday, but the

52
00:03:26,962 --> 00:03:29,518
one coming up so.

53
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,490
If anyone else had available,
maybe we'll hash out some last

54
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,890
minute things 'cause I'm sure
we'll have some as well.

55
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:43,860
Yeah. Really good idea. So my
mentioned that in Ms teams so

56
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,030
that everyone else knows that if
if they are available on

57
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,850
Saturday we might have a last

58
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:57,722
minute thing. And then it's
probably due Sunday night, isn't

59
00:03:57,722 --> 00:04:03,264
it? Yeah. That's why we
gotta get some. Read all the

60
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:06,520
spelling mistakes on the website
that I just copied and pasted

61
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,564
it. I do that for my job so I
could help out there. I've

62
00:04:10,564 --> 00:04:14,308
looked at capital of times and
like how did I miss that? Don't

63
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:16,324
know why. How did word miss that

64
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:20,301
spelling mistake? I'm telling
you there's not much squared

65
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,720
picks up on.

66
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,428
This would be right if it was
American spelling. Change the

67
00:04:26,428 --> 00:04:28,996
setting like fix, fix, fix, fix,

68
00:04:28,996 --> 00:04:32,560
fix. I'm so I've gotta add
an ideal job section. Don't

69
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,795
lie to the web page.

70
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,650
For yourself or know for
everyone for everybody. And then

71
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,238
I'm thinking the home page will
be the comparison. Was like I'll

72
00:04:42,238 --> 00:04:46,125
do a tab style like the other
industry data where it's got the

73
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,713
individual ones so you can click
their names to just get their

74
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:53,130
ideal job summary. That's just
the paragraph where it's like

75
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,810
this is my ideal job and then
we'll do the comparison on the

76
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,130
main page I guess. Yeah, no. I
think the comparison was just

77
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,090
know know the because the
comparison is worth 2 points. We

78
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,050
were just going to try to
paragraph. I think Daniel you've

79
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,650
already done. Yeah, I've got
mine. Mines currently in the

80
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,170
personal information section
like profile section. Just

81
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,770
another paragraph at the end of
those profile personality test

82
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,650
things. Yeah. So just a
paragraph saying how?

83
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,054
Our job is similar to or
different to the other peoples

84
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:31,782
drugs. Yeah, the questions are
in the in the PDF and summit

85
00:05:31,782 --> 00:05:37,298
too, so the graph or the diagram
or something or other was on the

86
00:05:37,298 --> 00:05:40,056
industry to answer because
that's worth more.

87
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,084
That makes

88
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:50,008
sense, Adam. I think
we kind of concluded that that

89
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:55,900
could still be some are we. We
started to Draw Something up,

90
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,864
you contributed to it.

91
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:05,310
Meeting Typing
into the yeah yeah.

92
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,162
And for

93
00:06:08,162 --> 00:06:12,138
skills. Necessary for a job.

94
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,180
Las data, yeah. I think we can
probably have it.

95
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,077
I different able to that as
well, which just lists which

96
00:06:21,077 --> 00:06:25,241
skills I think, sort of which
skills are needed. While he had

97
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:29,058
like our names and then the
skills and then ranked like

98
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:32,528
which skill is important to
whoever's job you were gonna

99
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:35,304
generalize the skills in the
groups, won't we?

100
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,074
Yeah, like communication and

101
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:43,435
stuff, yeah. Different

102
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:47,880
jobs. Yeah, I know they kind of
blurring together and they

103
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,996
didn't have to make it to Jen
and make a table for us for

104
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:55,524
that. That's what I meant, but
I'm not sure that that covers

105
00:06:55,524 --> 00:06:56,700
the burning glass stuff.

106
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:02,070
Yeah, I'm not. I'm not sure if
that would get us marks per say.

107
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:06,230
Yeah, 'cause that was prior that
was us putting in what our the

108
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,430
job we chose on the previous
assignment. What each individual

109
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,270
skill on that chart was rated
based on what we thought the

110
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,790
employer would. 'cause I think
there were three sections of the

111
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,990
burning glass data where they
had three different tables for

112
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,870
the different criteria that the
data was looking at.

113
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:29,830
Yeah, so if we group if we make
a table or chart that basically

114
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,060
uses that same.

115
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,098
Like the same criteria is what
how they listed that data. We

116
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:36,622
could do a table that way.

117
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,300
Yeah yeah yeah I will.

118
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,398
'cause it is, as long as we're
presenting data that looks like

119
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:50,438
it was from the burning gas
starter, it's really our

120
00:07:50,438 --> 00:07:53,670
interpretation of what our job
requires. Different skills.

121
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,664
On Wednesdays, we can, we just
do another like read through of

122
00:07:57,664 --> 00:08:00,984
that section and just spend 10
minutes just literally reading

123
00:08:00,984 --> 00:08:03,972
through what the questions are.
Then we can all.

124
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,476
I think as long as we've all
done are burning last stuff.

125
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,965
Well go through data, format it
on the next meeting. Yeah,

126
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:11,970
that's good idea.

127
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:19,379
Yeah, yeah.
So by Wednesday.

128
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,020
And they will have.

129
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,051
Each of our individual things
done, except for maybe some of

130
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:32,740
the group project technical
stuff between Daniel and Adam.

131
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,444
But you'll have a draft ready by

132
00:08:36,444 --> 00:08:40,638
then, Daniel. Technic reflection
basically as much as I can do

133
00:08:40,638 --> 00:08:43,102
until I just get out of my

134
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:46,292
depth. We all have a working on

135
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:51,838
as well. Yeah, so it will have
all that writing done by then.

136
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:55,182
Basically yeah, hopefully
actually. Yeah yeah yeah, I

137
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:58,526
think that's the writing
sections assigned to everyone

138
00:08:58,526 --> 00:09:03,124
basically and then just be a
formatting issue. And that is

139
00:09:03,124 --> 00:09:07,304
how we throw formatting graphs
and adding the technical details

140
00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:09,812
and then the uploading to the

141
00:09:09,812 --> 00:09:13,612
website. Yeah yeah,

142
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:15,960
yeah. Yeah, yeah.

143
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,060
Do you want to live?

144
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,448
The door saying.

145
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:26,394
Will wrap up the recording
there, shall we?

146
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,105
Recording again. Yeah,

147
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:35,239
yeah. His condition count as
another meeting. I think it's

148
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:38,687
it's a meeting. Yeah, yeah,
Sweet Yeah Alright.
