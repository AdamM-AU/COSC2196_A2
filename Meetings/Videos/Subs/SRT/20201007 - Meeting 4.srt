1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,484
Is there any way to indicate
that it's recording?

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,632
This red icon. Oh yeah, there it

3
00:00:10,632 --> 00:00:14,510
goes. Awesome, so this is my
first time chairing a meeting

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,166
ever. So go easy on me.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:24,170
So it's the 7th of
October 2020 meeting #5 I

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:30,388
believe. And yeah, so we all got
our results back for our

7
00:00:30,388 --> 00:00:32,628
assignment, one this week or

8
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:38,106
yesterday. Congratulations
everyone, I think you all did

9
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:45,406
pretty well. Nichols, Adam got
full marks for the website

10
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:51,798
so. Good job for that I
think I should have made my

11
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:53,172
profile longer there.

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,380
So is there anything that?

13
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,210
Someone wants to
discuss about the.

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,790
The assignment or anything like
any feedback that they thought

15
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,140
was interesting? Or did Tim
offer any suggestions for future

16
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,145
assignments or anything?

17
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,408
He did on mine could because I
legitimately couldn't think of

18
00:01:11,408 --> 00:01:16,478
what to put in an app like like
I could think of the content to

19
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,520
having the app, but I couldn't
think of the.

20
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,540
Technology features to have in
the app kind of focused on the

21
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,380
content rather than the
features, so he gave me a few

22
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,700
suggestions on features.

23
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:39,360
And I remember what my score was
for that. But I I had lower

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,530
scores just due to not having a
lot of my teeth.

25
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,858
Technology in it.

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,038
And so he gave me stretch into
that and then with my website.

27
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:59,470
He said, obviously mine was very
simple so I got half marks

28
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,860
there. And so he just said that
I need to incorporate more HTML.

29
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:09,660
Basically. And I think if I was
a bit more prepared or I

30
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,880
understood a bit more.

31
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,424
Have a fair bit more in there.

32
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:24,785
Yeah.
Too

33
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:32,918
much.
In some things.

34
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,510
Far from

35
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:43,020
it. I got was just he suggested
rubric more as opposed to what's

36
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,740
worth the most marks.

37
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,538
'cause I did cut back on like
ideal job for example, I didn't

38
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:55,050
and I think profile to like this
to fit in the profile.

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,870
He said 'cause it was one
of the higher markets.

40
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,822
The rest of his comments are

41
00:03:04,822 --> 00:03:09,950
pretty good. Yeah, love
the project idea.

42
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,773
Love my, except obviously I was
just missing a few things.

43
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,020
Everything else is really happy

44
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,095
with. I think George
is a bit hard done by.

45
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,020
Yeah.

46
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,860
I did.

47
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,952
Hey. Did he pop the

48
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:40,655
feedback? Are you just talking
about the Max?

49
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,020
Yeah, they're pretty hot.

50
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,622
But then again, you don't know

51
00:03:45,622 --> 00:03:50,018
whether. He changed it again,
lights admission for the last

52
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:55,366
10%. 'cause of that or so? I'm
just not sure. He may. He may

53
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:58,804
have missed the PDF report to
you, don't know.

54
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,749
I didn't look too much of these
website only. I only skimmed on

55
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:07,321
everyone's website so. I really
still don't know what do you put

56
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:10,941
in there. A process that's

57
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:16,710
fine. How do
you go, Daniel?

58
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:23,340
Um? Is my audio OK, by
the way, 'cause I switched

59
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,433
laptops, kids alright, it's a
little bit noisy, but it's OK,

60
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:32,246
yeah? Volume so I wasn't getting
anything in the test. I did have

61
00:04:32,246 --> 00:04:33,914
you got the power plugged in?

62
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,480
Yes, maybe if you unplug
the power it might reduce

63
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,944
some of the noise.

64
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,604
Batteries screwed on this one.
OK then don't worry about it. So

65
00:04:45,604 --> 00:04:48,974
sometimes if there's like a bad
how connection the microphone

66
00:04:48,974 --> 00:04:50,996
can get a little bit noisy.

67
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:57,097
Yeah.
That's what's on

68
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,851
my end now.
Whatever you just

69
00:04:59,851 --> 00:05:01,228
done? Yeah, sorry.

70
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,180
Is it just one?

71
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:10,024
Echo. Is this noise? But it's
a lot quieter.

72
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,312
Actually, I can hear myself
coming back really clearly.

73
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,028
I can hear everyone coming back.

74
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,464
Several Times Now, I'd say
someone speakers are up

75
00:05:22,464 --> 00:05:23,116
too loud.

76
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,866
Alright then just unplugged hold
up there, yeah, yeah.

77
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,300
No, that's worse.

78
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:41,572
Whatever you had gone the first
time might have been the best

79
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:43,390
option so far.

80
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:51,418
Whatever you've got going
now isn't working.

81
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,680
We've got no audio,
Daniel.

82
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:09,460
That
Yeah, we can hear. Maybe when

83
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,035
you're not talking to Mike
otherwise we're going to have a

84
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:14,985
buzz the whole time. Yep Yep

85
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:17,290
Yep, Yep. OK.

86
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,020
That's
good.

87
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,069
Now I'll just sit here and get

88
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:34,290
busy. OK, I'll just get
this over with. I

89
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,855
just got next.

90
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:42,020
I I got like this in the rubric
I got the second one from the

91
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,740
end all the way down.

92
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,444
So. I guess I was kind of
consistent. I didn't get great

93
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:49,460
marks on the project.

94
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,504
But on the project idea, but it
wasn't too bad. Overall I

95
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:57,616
thought I was only going to get.
I was aiming for 50 to 70 so I

96
00:06:57,616 --> 00:06:59,158
got 78 so I was happy.

97
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:06,660
So that's good. Yeah, I think
most of us got around 80. Hey,

98
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,190
yeah, yeah like.

99
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:13,518
That all is expecting lower,
yeah, I was expecting.

100
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,052
Not really if you consistently
get around 80. That's still a HD

101
00:07:19,052 --> 00:07:24,584
so that's still yeah be a GPA
that's maximum marks. So yeah,

102
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:26,889
so maximum results with minimum

103
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:32,858
effort. Yeah, that's good, I
think website wise, we're

104
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:37,826
looking pretty good like it's
looking very professional.

105
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,774
Sam, I think will get good marks

106
00:07:41,774 --> 00:07:43,484
there. Not a template or

107
00:07:43,484 --> 00:07:46,806
anything so. Not pretty

108
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:50,810
good. 'cause I saw some of the,
uh, the ones you showed on.

109
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,370
Oh yeah.

110
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,558
Yeah, it's really good.

111
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,695
Yeah, the artwork was really
cool. That yes, right?

112
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,930
The red button yeah yeah.

113
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:11,639
That's hilarious. Right, 10
seconds to turn it off.

114
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:17,652
Next we need an air raid siren
to play play with that as well.

115
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:21,645
I I thought about it, but
browsers now, mute audio sources

116
00:08:21,645 --> 00:08:26,001
by default. 'cause pop up ads
that used to. You know like

117
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:29,994
noises and stuff, and play music
in the background. Yeah, what

118
00:08:29,994 --> 00:08:33,261
about those ones that pop up.
YouTube videos that

119
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:36,165
automatically start playing that
because you've already 'cause

120
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,617
you clicked on it.

121
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,550
No, the ones that you don't
click like you scroll scroll

122
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,980
past it and you can there's
audio somewhere playing

123
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,600
somewhere, you have to scroll up

124
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,470
and find it. No

125
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,414
rest. Yeah, yeah, I know

126
00:08:52,414 --> 00:08:57,480
the ones. The first time that it
goes to do it normally asks you

127
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,920
or brings a pop up. Do you want

128
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,320
to allow it? Yeah.

129
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,128
Like son allow officially.

130
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:13,414
Everyone. What
time, the what time the To Do

131
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:18,840
List? So next time on the agenda
I've got the progress report.

132
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,640
Further. No,

133
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,190
we didn't. Yeah, somehow I got
four out of five on the personal

134
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,420
information, I put.

135
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,094
Very little personal information

136
00:09:34,094 --> 00:09:39,488
at all. The project I did a
project idea did well. Got 28 on

137
00:09:39,488 --> 00:09:44,211
that one. 15 on the profile, but
he didn't leave me any feedback

138
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:51,340
on why. Ideal job 22 interest
in ITA to 10. Presentation 10

139
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,204
or 10. So 80

140
00:09:55,204 --> 00:10:00,986
seven o'clock. Interesting RT
got low because I've.

141
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,076
You got 8 of

142
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:12,390
10. Yeah.
I mean a job it on a

143
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,040
Fitbit, maybe didn't want that.

144
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:22,080
Pretty pretty OK with everything
so on the rubric I got the

145
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:29,165
second highest for most of them
except for the ideal job, I got

146
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:30,800
the highest one.

147
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:36,010
So just because that's probably
the one I spent the least effort

148
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,080
on I notice. We all got 8 for
interest of IT, except for

149
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,640
Shannon that got 8.5.

150
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:47,629
I wonder if I wonder if Tim was
just like copy, paste, copy,

151
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:51,076
paste these. Otherwise I'll that
realize what I'm doing.

152
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:55,965
My feedback for on the rubric
for interest in ITV, as you seem

153
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:58,590
to have a good interest in IT.

154
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,948
Boilerplate is swimming.

155
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,022
I can't remember which one, but
there was like one of my schools

156
00:11:06,022 --> 00:11:09,036
where he gave he said really
like positive feedback. He was

157
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:12,598
like he did great with her. She
did great with that right with

158
00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:15,886
this and then with no negative
feedback and I didn't get it

159
00:11:15,886 --> 00:11:19,448
grade that kind of match the
words he was saying. Yeah I was

160
00:11:19,448 --> 00:11:22,569
like. Must be higher.

161
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,407
They overall Mark I didn't
understand but that, but like I

162
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:31,931
think it was my introduction or
get to know me profile something

163
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:38,940
other. Thank you very, very very
well. But I'm not gonna make you

164
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,740
biased. What was that noise?

165
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,550
The kids.

166
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,158
And I was a.

167
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:54,310
Outlook.
Dictation.

168
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,120
Making music.

169
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,027
Do you guys know about a GitHub

170
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:04,580
tutorial? Thing from 7:00 PM to

171
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,925
8:00 PM. I think it wasn't Adam

172
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:08,780
Gonna show you. GitHub.

173
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,050
Or teach anyone GitHub if they

174
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,530
needed it. Yeah.

175
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,540
OK.

176
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:23,886
That notification Adam
was about a

177
00:12:23,886 --> 00:12:27,549
GitHub tutorial theme.

178
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:32,220
Gonna do after. Yeah, did you
still wanna do it? Yeah 'cause I

179
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,224
think George wanted to do it as
well, but I don't think he's

180
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:39,650
gonna be. Here.

181
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:43,990
The only comment I got on my
rubric as I put in the source

182
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,330
code, I doubt anyone will look
here and then he put I did this.

183
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,748
So easy to write.

184
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,110
Very professional or
unprofessional. Very

185
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,942
professional website.
Easy to read through.

186
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:03,607
Sir. I've been like using the
developer Tools on my browser to

187
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:07,171
look at like code for websites
and that just to sort of

188
00:13:07,171 --> 00:13:09,844
immersed myself forbidden.
There's stuff like that all the

189
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:13,260
time, yeah? Yeah, selected
pretty stuff, pretty funny

190
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,640
stuff. And yeah although giving
a shout out to like their friend

191
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,830
or something like Yo dude check

192
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:23,100
this out. Yeah, it's

193
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,190
good. Sorry, I interrupted you
before saying when I asked you

194
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,367
what was that much of you this?

195
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,056
So, so next time just got like

196
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:38,580
a. Progress report to see how
everyones doing like with the

197
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,324
The technology reports in the
project and stuff.

198
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:47,797
So I think I think Shannon
you've pretty much done your

199
00:13:47,797 --> 00:13:50,050
report. Care for fun?

200
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,380
It's it's on there, I'm still.

201
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,774
I'm kind of happy with it I

202
00:13:55,774 --> 00:14:00,378
guess. I could still use more in
text citation, but I I think I

203
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:01,682
covered exactly where I

204
00:14:01,682 --> 00:14:05,630
actually. Used a reference.

205
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,720
Yeah.

206
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,714
I know I'm pretty happy with the

207
00:14:10,714 --> 00:14:13,288
report Wednesday. Yeah, I'm
pretty much the same with mine.

208
00:14:13,288 --> 00:14:14,835
It's a little bit bloated, so I

209
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:16,850
might. Edit some stuff out

210
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:21,839
later, but. It shows that the
Blockchain and Crypto isn't it.

211
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,313
Yeah, I did not notice. I don't
know if it's a typo, you have.

212
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:29,659
What is technology?
Technological developments make

213
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:32,396
is wait. What technical
technological developments make

214
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:37,088
is possible? I'm assuming it's
meant to be it, but you have

215
00:14:37,088 --> 00:14:40,216
that heading twice. Oh,
different lots of text.

216
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,760
OK, I'll probably. I'll look
that up, Yeah?

217
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,540
I am What's that it
is the most marks for this

218
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,240
assessment, so yeah, if anyone's
not happy with what someone's

219
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,290
got, then label means or I feel
that can be added. As I said, if

220
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,260
you feel like changing my
report, I don't care, just add

221
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,340
some stuff to it.

222
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,210
I think George finished his.

223
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:13,460
Hey. Yeah.
I haven't completed mine, but I

224
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:18,920
uploaded a file showing you guys
where I'm at right now, which is

225
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,600
a bit over halfway.

226
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,240
Ann, I haven't done any.

227
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,400
In Text Citation 'cause I'm.

228
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,440
Not really sure how to do that.

229
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:37,340
But I'm just adding all my
references down the bottom and

230
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,850
will come back and fix those
references up to make them

231
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,950
easier to do in text citation.
Is every time you.

232
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,370
Bring up like evidence or
something or something that you

233
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,790
didn't like. Obtain yourself.

234
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,762
So if you like reading article
or something, you just the

235
00:15:55,762 --> 00:15:59,688
easiest ways to do like brackets
and then the name of the person

236
00:15:59,688 --> 00:16:01,802
and then the date or the year.

237
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:05,853
If you want to get really like
academic like you can say you

238
00:16:05,853 --> 00:16:08,652
know this person's findings
brackets the year and then.

239
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,950
Do they do it that way.

240
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:19,405
Oh no, I did I have done too.
I've done a quote from Elon Musk

241
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:22,387
and I just afterwards I wrote

242
00:16:22,387 --> 00:16:28,647
like CEO. Sorry dash. Elon Musk,
CEO of Tesla at the China AI

243
00:16:28,647 --> 00:16:34,068
Conference in July 2020, but I
haven't put a link there. I do

244
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:37,404
have a link to a video where he

245
00:16:37,404 --> 00:16:39,880
said it. Um?

246
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:45,906
That's just in my references
down below but do you guys know

247
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:50,834
if I'm supposed to like add a
hyperlink to that quote

248
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:54,684
somewhere, although? That's
usually the best like maybe from

249
00:16:54,684 --> 00:16:59,268
the sound of what you've you've
written like just put the date

250
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,796
the year in brackets.

251
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,816
OK, and then yeah, and if the if
the reference says like Elan

252
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:09,800
Musk is like the author or
whatever, then you can put him

253
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,128
in the brackets too.

254
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:17,088
Or whoever was doing the article
or whatever it was. It was well.

255
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:22,236
It's talked about all over the
Internet, but it was in a video

256
00:17:22,236 --> 00:17:26,592
conference that he said. And the
recording is on YouTube from

257
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:30,948
Tesla China, which I'm not
certain is like it's that's the

258
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:35,304
only video they have there and
the only description of the

259
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,868
channel is the China, their
monthly specific thing for

260
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:42,828
referencing conferences as well.
Maybe look up like a Harvard

261
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:48,302
Guide. Further Want the link and
then just at the time and where

262
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:49,934
in the video he said it.

263
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:55,710
Knock. And then the
other one was.

264
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:03,156
I wish
I was

265
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:09,975
referencing. Something called
the Society of automated and

266
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:11,910
automotive engineers, an.

267
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:16,324
I said they created a standard
standard for less levels of

268
00:18:16,324 --> 00:18:19,864
driving automation, and then
I've got. That's the title of

269
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:24,112
the standard and then I've just
put dash and then the link.

270
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,575
Dash and then continue my
sentence, but I appreciate

271
00:18:27,575 --> 00:18:29,640
that's not how that
supposed to look.

272
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,830
So I'm not really sure how to do

273
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,060
that. Have to see it to workout.

274
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,624
To workout the best way but I
could, I could help if you put

275
00:18:40,624 --> 00:18:42,192
it on the thing I can have a

276
00:18:42,192 --> 00:18:45,220
look in. Offering you
suggestions or anything like

277
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,240
that. Um.

278
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:56,813
Gonna take me a second you
guys wanna talk about something.

279
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:02,130
So, so the the project has
that going guys.

280
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,318
I looked into the API but I
haven't written anything yet.

281
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,170
Yeah, for that, um Adam I was
wondering if you just wanted to

282
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,140
tell me whatever sections. You
don't want to write.

283
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,528
And I I'm not sure maybe the
motivation might be easiest for

284
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:20,948
me if I'm non technical.

285
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,646
Yeah, and a couple of others.
Pretty much yeah anything you

286
00:19:25,646 --> 00:19:30,350
want me to do, just tell me and
I will do it. Yeah, Exeter.

287
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:30,730
Um?

288
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,590
Yep. Or salmon ladder
available 90, so I can pop in

289
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:42,270
few pieces here and there for
the project to yeah, I can

290
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,830
help contribute as well.

291
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,010
Sorry, that was my alarm.

292
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:55,221
On a on a new iPhone that she
was flexing on the force.

293
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,846
Count to 8 weeks for it all to

294
00:19:57,846 --> 00:20:02,517
arrive. I wasn't trying to flex,
I was just getting really being

295
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:06,908
humorous. So it's
here.

296
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,816
Yeah guys say that Yep, Yep, so
that seems fine. I don't know if

297
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:16,936
it's like the Harvard Standard,

298
00:20:16,936 --> 00:20:21,714
But. Yeah, normally what you
would do is you would do it in

299
00:20:21,714 --> 00:20:24,981
text citation and then the link
would be in your references.

300
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,690
So that way you don't. That way
you don't have a big block of

301
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,265
text in your references. That
is, unless in your body, that

302
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:37,708
isn't unnecessary. OK, so would

303
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:42,899
I just. How would it in
text citation look?

304
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:49,754
It's like just after that bit
because that is the name of the.

305
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,828
Link right there.

306
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,548
How do I just?

307
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,087
Open brackets and say accessed
it at this date or open

308
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:01,244
brackets. It was created in
2016. I mean, I've already said

309
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:06,440
it's in 2016. So when you
when you accessed it or

310
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,160
whatever, that's usually in
your reference list, so.

311
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,860
Yeah, and the website would
probably be in the reference

312
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,579
list as well, OK, so I could
just remove that website drop it

313
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:23,572
down in my reference. List yeah,
OK and this, this, I've

314
00:21:23,572 --> 00:21:26,476
screenshotted from that
document. It says down the

315
00:21:26,476 --> 00:21:30,469
bottom that it can be the
summary table may be freely

316
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:34,462
copied and distributed provided
essay which is where I copied it

317
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:37,729
from international is are
acknowledged as the source and

318
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:42,448
must be reproduced as is so I
presume. I'm allowed to copy and

319
00:21:42,448 --> 00:21:43,900
paste it like that.

320
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,880
Yeah.

321
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,640
Yeah, cool. So

322
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,196
why not? Doing anything
wrong and now I don't know

323
00:21:54,196 --> 00:21:55,344
how to stop sharing.

324
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,630
Does anyone?

325
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,650
What? Is anyone given in Tesla?

326
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:11,498
No open in a taxi. Once in
Japan that was a Tesla.

327
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,184
Am I still sharing that screen?

328
00:22:15,184 --> 00:22:16,860
Yes. Right?

329
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,274
And it was by signs one
anywhere, we go around it just

330
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:22,958
doesn't work.

331
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:29,005
No.
What tests do, but you

332
00:22:29,005 --> 00:22:31,588
know, just sitting it up
and just watching it

333
00:22:31,588 --> 00:22:32,736
dance is just insane.

334
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,332
And it's a very, very spacious
considering the size of Yeah.

335
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:42,910
Also went on a completely
electric bus as well. That was a

336
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:47,005
bit trippy. Yeah, so that they
have them in Japan as well. Did

337
00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:48,580
you gonna bullet train, yeah.

338
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,090
What was that like with the

339
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:55,514
people pushes? Although they
don't usually on the bullet

340
00:22:55,514 --> 00:22:59,936
trains, but I've been on the
people pushing trains as well.

341
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,400
Bit uncomfortable, specially
when it's late. Last train on a

342
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,195
Saturday night and you're in the
middle of Arthur nightclub area.

343
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,392
Pretty girl. Don't be doing that
in open set with the people

344
00:23:11,392 --> 00:23:12,596
pushes on the train.

345
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,345
Yeah, the the Melbourne trains
like the seats are set up.

346
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,120
Really bad for high congestion.

347
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,246
Public transport. But anyway,
that's a different topic, yeah?

348
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:25,800
Cool.

349
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,288
Say with the IT project. Now
that few of us forgot.

350
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:36,468
Bit more bit more time to spare
I guess. Maybe we can help out

351
00:23:36,468 --> 00:23:38,617
if you need anything any help on

352
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:42,820
that. The apps can
actually.

353
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,169
So privacy app to check your
social media accounts

354
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:51,536
privacy settings and then
make recommendations or

355
00:23:51,536 --> 00:23:52,498
possibly changes.

356
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:59,944
Did we confirm that that it is
possible to view Facebook

357
00:23:59,944 --> 00:24:04,406
settings? We can't change
anything, yeah, OK cool and

358
00:24:04,406 --> 00:24:08,789
did we need to talk to him
about anything?

359
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,280
No, no
deliverables

360
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,740
will need a.

361
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,010
I think says it, so we need we
have deliverables for the app on

362
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,585
this assignment. Or is it the
next one? I don't think we do

363
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:27,160
for this one. I think you mighta
artifacts on the next one and

364
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,535
you need several of them.

365
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:34,227
Which Seattle sector rehash of
the project ID from the last

366
00:24:34,227 --> 00:24:37,117
one? Yeah yeah you must
copy and paste. I think

367
00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:37,906
from assignment one.

368
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,850
Since we're not using a project
idea from us anybody's

369
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:46,843
assignment one, we could just
switch to yours. You got pretty

370
00:24:46,843 --> 00:24:50,280
good marks. We could we could
help you in face baby.

371
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:56,580
Don't say. Mine was A
at the time bank.

372
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,510
My people. Yeah, given our take
an hour in exchange for a

373
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:06,570
service.
Cryptocurrency.

374
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,736
We could swap it to that.

375
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,662
Or an anybody is really it's

376
00:25:13,662 --> 00:25:19,998
already done. Yeah,
but I'm greatly.

377
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,211
Act Yeah, this is not really
worth that much effort, is it?

378
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,128
Just say the the.

379
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,587
The assessment sheet that you
need to expand on.

380
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:40,229
The items from assignment one,
so you can't just copy and

381
00:25:40,229 --> 00:25:44,334
paste. They put they put that
little clause in there. Yeah, I

382
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,338
think you just have expanded on

383
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:49,826
it. Already too much when I did

384
00:25:49,826 --> 00:25:53,520
assessment one. So.

385
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,660
There is it? It's actually

386
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:03,980
fairly short. So I think a
lot of wood and a lot of the

387
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,555
marks be in the artifacts.

388
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:12,485
I don't think so for this
assignment. No, not not not

389
00:26:12,485 --> 00:26:14,710
number two I'm talking about

390
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:18,624
numbers. We need tangible
artifacts for the submission of

391
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:22,331
assignment 3. So in summary, we
actually have to have something

392
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,957
done with the project would have
to do a mock up of the website

393
00:26:25,957 --> 00:26:27,252
and some of the code.

394
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,770
And if you feel like a
promotional video or something

395
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:35,792
as well. Presentation in the
Laderas in the next assignment.

396
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:40,896
Yeah, the promotional video was
an option as one of the

397
00:26:40,896 --> 00:26:42,752
artifacts for number 3.

398
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,068
Just think like if we didn't
have ideas about that. If we

399
00:26:47,068 --> 00:26:51,735
didn't have a lot of code to
provide them, we could provide a

400
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:55,325
video describing what the
outward or how it will local

401
00:26:55,325 --> 00:27:00,351
bloody well just for this. If we
do the app, we can have some

402
00:27:00,351 --> 00:27:05,018
just image templates of what the
app is going to look like, some

403
00:27:05,018 --> 00:27:08,967
rough ones and some high quality
ones, and then other tangible

404
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:12,198
artifacts are our video
walkthroughs on for the Facebook

405
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:15,070
settings that we can't change
with the app.

406
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:20,439
That we have to give him a
tutorial for so they would have

407
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,091
been perfect deliverables. Yeah

408
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:25,834
yeah yeah. Yeah, whichever ones
more feasable I guess yeah.

409
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:30,962
The Apple ID is probably the
easiest one to do. Yeah, because

410
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:34,658
that's just some photoshopped
pictures, or we can use one of

411
00:27:34,658 --> 00:27:39,026
those tools that he linked to
us. Last time. I think it might

412
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:42,722
have been answering link. Just
two UI designers for apps and

413
00:27:42,722 --> 00:27:45,746
the videos, or we can just
recording with webcam.

414
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,460
Yeah, and open broadcast.

415
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,988
So we go to the website and
then we have to write a whole

416
00:27:55,988 --> 00:27:56,916
website and do images.

417
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,770
So we're thinking we might stick
with what we've got now.

418
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,899
At this stage.

419
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,585
Yeah,

420
00:28:10,585 --> 00:28:12,770
yeah.

421
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:18,990
Yeah.
Cooper is a

422
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:22,598
Can you hear me?

423
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:29,450
Time. Hello
really quiet

424
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:35,520
like.
Not better.

425
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,236
Yeah, little

426
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:47,698
bit. I don't know
if it's me or not.

427
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:54,618
Yeah, that's alright. I can turn
up my volume so I can just see.

428
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:58,060
Change. Problems

429
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:03,996
there. 3. Shannon
can yell but no one else Yo

430
00:29:03,996 --> 00:29:05,898
'cause I'm at full volume here.

431
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,630
For some reason, my volume on my
front panel just keeps on.

432
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,080
Dicking around.

433
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,630
I can hear I can hear you
fine now. Not not normal,

434
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,130
but I can hear you.

435
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:24,285
Yeah. Too

436
00:29:24,285 --> 00:29:28,650
much. Sorry,
better.

437
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,324
Mark volume is moving by itself.
It doesn't make sense to me.

438
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,918
I might have corrupted it when I
was playing around with it

439
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:40,558
before. It's it's it that you
always at 80. Now it's slowly

440
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,030
climbing to 90 and it did jump
20 before so I don't know what's

441
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:51,364
going on? That's right, so
much gave me perfect.

442
00:29:51,364 --> 00:29:54,010
Now it's good.

443
00:29:54,010 --> 00:30:00,610
No so now now like that, we're
going to do next so.

444
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:05,950
I guess the thing that we all
need to sort of do is the ideal

445
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:10,617
jobs. Comparison. So now that
we've got the results back we

446
00:30:10,617 --> 00:30:15,110
can. Have a better idea of our
ideal jobs were good enough or

447
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:19,350
not so. OK, I think that's The
One I did best actually.

448
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:25,746
I think I did Alright there. You
said that my I picked a similar

449
00:30:25,746 --> 00:30:30,714
answer to most other people in
the most people picked a entry

450
00:30:30,714 --> 00:30:31,956
level or general.

451
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,566
Just like you Sam I think.

452
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:40,146
Specifically, entry level, one,
but it was sort of like the

453
00:30:40,146 --> 00:30:45,138
upper level of if you would
choosing a broad path so yeah,

454
00:30:45,138 --> 00:30:48,340
sorry? Yeah. Except George.

455
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:56,960
Yeah. Ken
16 online

456
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,969
But mainly because my
description wasn't for the job

457
00:31:02,969 --> 00:31:05,828
posted. I got 21.

458
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,650
At 22

459
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,540
20 Why don't
we push down?

460
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:22,035
I'm Jenna. OK, thank you, I
didn't even finish my sentence

461
00:31:22,035 --> 00:31:25,730
and. Where I get?

462
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:32,285
21.
Ideal

463
00:31:32,285 --> 00:31:39,642
job.
I just checked Georges

464
00:31:39,642 --> 00:31:46,826
IT technology submission for
cloud services and servers

465
00:31:46,826 --> 00:31:50,418
is not finished that

466
00:31:50,418 --> 00:31:55,230
argue. You have got typos,
and yeah, there's big

467
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,505
chunks sing so.

468
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:03,138
I know Tim said a lot of IT
professionals started with first

469
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:06,770
level support. That's what I
meant, Sam, OK?

470
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,596
Not not anything to do with.

471
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:16,880
So yeah, so we sort
of needlework yet how to?

472
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,328
Use the ideal job comparison so.

473
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,465
Yeah, we need to sort of
workout? What differentiates

474
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:27,590
between all our positions and.

475
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,510
I feel like that stuff.

476
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:34,388
I just wrote a paragraph doing
that like from my perspective,

477
00:32:34,388 --> 00:32:36,378
yeah, so that was good.

478
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,700
So could we?

479
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,210
Could we do like a quote from
each of us stating?

480
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,190
How ALP, but our choice was
different to other peoples

481
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:53,520
choices. We do a graffle.

482
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,520
Something. Typing at the end I

483
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,882
guess. This to you could do it,
rotting and doing like visual

484
00:33:02,882 --> 00:33:04,058
elements as well.

485
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,280
And you're pretty much get
marked on how concise everything

486
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,210
is, so if we're all doing
separate paragraphs, that might

487
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,261
not be as consistent as it could

488
00:33:13,261 --> 00:33:18,836
be. No. So could we do
a graph with like?

489
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,876
We could identify some of the
features that are common in the

490
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,927
jobs and then on one access have

491
00:33:24,927 --> 00:33:28,510
like. Entry level

492
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:33,230
Specific or security and then
each one that fits into

493
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:38,422
security. It'll be on the other
axis or something like that.

494
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,431
We need to workout some criteria
for if we're gonna do like a

495
00:33:42,431 --> 00:33:46,115
table thing, like some broad
criteria and then we can add a

496
00:33:46,115 --> 00:33:50,106
bit of information of each of us
in there to see who's more

497
00:33:50,106 --> 00:33:51,334
similar and who's more

498
00:33:51,334 --> 00:33:56,495
different. When we're getting is
a radar graph for that.

499
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:02,400
For the Does the
industry daughter? I think yeah.

500
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,472
Which is an LC very similar.
There are similar but a bit

501
00:34:07,472 --> 00:34:10,240
different out of the industry
data was like.

502
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:15,834
So the industry daughter is more
what what skills are in demand.

503
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,954
So, which section are we
comparing in so the ideal job

504
00:34:20,954 --> 00:34:27,891
one. If you go to
the assignment PDF page 4,

505
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:31,136
coming to canvas going too.

506
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,880
Minutes and then the assignment
and then click the PDF there's

507
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,240
two sections that mention.

508
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,506
Jobs one of them is about

509
00:34:39,506 --> 00:34:44,538
industry data. Yeah, and the
other one is about us. Each

510
00:34:44,538 --> 00:34:47,976
comparing our job selection to
the other people. People

511
00:34:47,976 --> 00:34:52,178
selections in the industry data.
When it refers back to the

512
00:34:52,178 --> 00:34:57,144
assignment page. Not the PDF but
where you get the PDF it refers

513
00:34:57,144 --> 00:34:59,436
to a link on that page.

514
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,530
Um? Wait, you can look up.

515
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,264
Ah, how frequently people are
looking for the time skills that

516
00:35:07,264 --> 00:35:09,952
are listed in your job that you

517
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,470
picked. That's OK.

518
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,040
Yeah, I just did that.

519
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,696
I did the industry data on this
afternoon, which is pretty much

520
00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:21,732
just the same as Shannon did it
just answering all the questions

521
00:35:21,732 --> 00:35:22,997
in the industry data section.

522
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:27,840
Yeah, so am I getting that
right? Shannon don't know.

523
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:34,048
So industry data is page 5 by
the way, and then the ideal job

524
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,683
is the page for yeah.

525
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:37,590
Hi.

526
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,677
I just I was looking at the.

527
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,379
Obviously, the rubric of how
much point marks yet for it.

528
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:50,014
And it's not like industry data
is pretty high, up as opposed to

529
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:54,326
profile and it just seems the
what we have in the ideal job in

530
00:35:54,326 --> 00:35:57,406
the profile outweighs? How much
we have in industry data.

531
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,680
That makes sense. 9.

532
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,968
So you're saying.

533
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:08,000
Is the is the job comparison
weighing more than the

534
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,745
industry data and industry
data is weighing more than

535
00:36:10,745 --> 00:36:13,795
the profile so team profile
pretty much has all the

536
00:36:13,795 --> 00:36:16,845
different things in it, and
the so the ideal jobs.

537
00:36:16,845 --> 00:36:19,895
Further team profile. You'd
say, would be like 2 points

538
00:36:19,895 --> 00:36:24,165
out of the five or one point
out of five when you get the

539
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:27,215
industry. Data is worth 10
out of the possible 100.

540
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:33,296
OK, at 10 miles out of 100 where
instead of the ideal jobs in

541
00:36:33,296 --> 00:36:35,599
team profiles worth to be out of

542
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,100
the 100. Just just seems what
I have in industry dad. I'm

543
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,647
just answering the questions,
seems very lacking for the

544
00:36:41,647 --> 00:36:44,477
section of 10 points as
opposed to how much I've

545
00:36:44,477 --> 00:36:46,458
written for ideal job in team
profile.

546
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,164
I think that's where it'll help.
If we've got that spider web

547
00:36:52,164 --> 00:36:53,652
graph comparing the different

548
00:36:53,652 --> 00:36:56,282
skills. In the industry auto

549
00:36:56,282 --> 00:37:01,532
section. Yeah, for the table in
ideal jobs, it can just be super

550
00:37:01,532 --> 00:37:05,684
basic like almost just our names
and then the positions like and

551
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:09,490
then maybe expand another couple
of fields. But yeah, you can

552
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:13,642
just be super simple I think
like one accesses our name and

553
00:37:13,642 --> 00:37:16,064
our job title access
similarities or differences,

554
00:37:16,064 --> 00:37:18,486
yeah, maybe some if we just do.

555
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:25,212
Maybe at the fields of the job
titles. Maybe have a tiny bit of

556
00:37:25,212 --> 00:37:28,636
overlap or even just hardware
based software based.

557
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:32,406
Something broad like that and
not not touch on any of the

558
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:35,849
skill set stuff and label the
skill set stuff for the

559
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:37,101
industry data section, yeah?

560
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:42,780
So probably break it up into
like software hardware, customer

561
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:47,125
facing non customer facing. Yeah
nice broad fields for the jobs

562
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:51,470
and then just do a line graph
and where they overlap.

563
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,075
Yeah, yeah. And then you got it
there, yeah and then and then

564
00:37:56,075 --> 00:37:59,615
we just do our paragraph each
and that's ideal jobs done sort

565
00:37:59,615 --> 00:38:02,860
of things 'cause for the for
the exemplary Marks and team

566
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,810
profile it just says a clear
discussion of the differences

567
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:06,990
between your ideal jobs.

568
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,016
That's it, yeah, so did we need
ideal jobs in our individual

569
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:18,493
profiles. Or do we just put that
thing and we needed to? I think

570
00:38:18,493 --> 00:38:20,390
that was what it that's in the

571
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:25,931
group profile. If we do, we have
a spot for a collective group

572
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:27,936
description of some or some

573
00:38:27,936 --> 00:38:31,686
sort. Details. The home

574
00:38:31,686 --> 00:38:36,392
page. Do you like a little bit
of like an about us? Yeah

575
00:38:36,392 --> 00:38:37,716
paragraph or something, yeah.

576
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:43,832
Or like we could change the team
profiles and push the individual

577
00:38:43,832 --> 00:38:49,825
pictures down and we can put
text in there for like a summary

578
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:54,359
of everybody. And I'm I'm
thinking just just for this spot

579
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:58,369
like is there just for this
topic about different jobs?

580
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:02,379
Because it's not each individual
person. It's all of us

581
00:39:02,379 --> 00:39:07,191
collectively on one graph is
that? Can we make a spot or?

582
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,556
Collective. He's about us not
not like a summary of us, but

583
00:39:13,556 --> 00:39:17,516
just somewhere after pizza
better jobs is that what I'm

584
00:39:17,516 --> 00:39:23,676
getting. Yeah, like a like a
spot where we can just put it

585
00:39:23,676 --> 00:39:27,806
graph that includes information
about all of our different jobs,

586
00:39:27,806 --> 00:39:34,001
a small gram. So if I just put
it on you page in under team

587
00:39:34,001 --> 00:39:38,957
profile called ideal jobs, we
can push it in there. Yeah yeah

588
00:39:38,957 --> 00:39:42,920
yeah. 'cause it doesn't fit
under 1 profile. It doesn't fit

589
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,848
under one yet. Even I think sums
of weather team or the ideal job

590
00:39:47,848 --> 00:39:52,072
in there, you know in all same
profile already. I just copied

591
00:39:52,072 --> 00:39:54,184
offered and it honestly in his.

592
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,604
Oregon is still OK to have that
and then have a summary as well.

593
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,740
Yeah, sorry, I lost track of
what you're talking about

594
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:09,371
showing. So Dan, annoying. I'm
not too sure if anyone else is

595
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:13,250
done it in the profile
themselves. We've given ideal

596
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:16,698
job in a paragraph underneath.
Yeah, simple simplistic

597
00:40:16,698 --> 00:40:20,577
paragraph with differences and
similarities to everyone in our

598
00:40:20,577 --> 00:40:22,275
group, OK? Did you want to just

599
00:40:22,275 --> 00:40:26,570
leave it there then? Do you mean
I see no reason why you get

600
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,010
marked down for having extra?

601
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,488
He did say he didn't want him to

602
00:40:30,488 --> 00:40:32,240
leave. Yeah.

603
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,709
OK, just like a description
paragraph, then describing how

604
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:39,096
it's differential similar to
everyone else is.

605
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:45,010
Yeah. Two or three
questions in the ideal job

606
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:48,778
section. OK. Yeah, and so.

607
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:55,306
So we'll stick to making putting
a bit more information in the

608
00:40:55,306 --> 00:40:58,792
industry data section, because
that's way more.

609
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:02,610
Yep. Ann

610
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:07,952
So once we've all completed our
industry data like.

611
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:14,389
Does Shannon?
Trying and Daniel.

612
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:18,058
Yeah, so once we

613
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:22,640
I think Shannons down at George
is done at an.

614
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:26,362
Send an in George of done
industry data. Have you done

615
00:41:26,362 --> 00:41:31,010
yours? Said no no, I had to look
at the burning glass but I

616
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:34,662
didn't like commit anything to
write yet. Yeah I uploaded mine

617
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:38,314
to the to GitHub but I haven't
actually uploaded it to.

618
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,060
Ms teams I don't mind I didn't
take it for an get so I'll grab

619
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:47,200
it from there and it pretty much
all I did was look at the big

620
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,788
chart that had all the skills
like rank to what was the number

621
00:41:50,788 --> 00:41:54,100
one skill and then the lower
skill. That's pretty much all I

622
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:59,668
got so far. So what I've
actually done, sorry.

623
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:04,730
I just waiting the rubric tears
you have clearly and accurately

624
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:09,330
identified and ranked your
groups required skill set now in

625
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:15,310
team profile on teams I did make
a graph table setup using Green

626
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,820
Glass Garden. Um.

627
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,288
That could probably go
into industry down.

628
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:24,138
But where is it?

629
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:28,199
For graphing teams, tables for
grub, yeah, I was thinking we

630
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:32,627
could use that for that spider
web thing, but now I'm thinking

631
00:42:32,627 --> 00:42:37,055
that would be better suited to
the industry data where it used

632
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:40,376
the burning glass and then
separates us into different.

633
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,545
Shows Yeah. I'm not too

634
00:42:45,545 --> 00:42:49,750
sure. So maybe before the next
meeting like we can all.

635
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,440
Finalize that burning glass
things individually. Then the

636
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,165
next meeting we can all

637
00:42:55,165 --> 00:42:59,120
collaborate and. Workout what we
can, how we can bring it all

638
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:04,994
together. Possibly. Yeah I
have. I have consolidated some

639
00:43:04,994 --> 00:43:09,698
of the headings into like a one.
For example all the programming

640
00:43:09,698 --> 00:43:11,266
language I've just put

641
00:43:11,266 --> 00:43:17,023
programming skills. The thing
you were talking about before

642
00:43:17,023 --> 00:43:19,859
Shannon, whatever use brought

643
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:22,392
together from. Burning glasses

644
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:26,810
that was going. Yeah, I'm not
sure I understand what you're

645
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,030
talking about, so I see it.

646
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:32,840
But it sounds like you've got
something sorted already. Is

647
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,364
that what you're saying?

648
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:36,956
Typing with all their names down

649
00:43:36,956 --> 00:43:41,553
the side. Adams adding and
editing it. At the moment I'm

650
00:43:41,553 --> 00:43:45,837
just looking at it trying to
workout. What kind of graph I

651
00:43:45,837 --> 00:43:46,908
can make it.

652
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,626
That actually looks pretty cool
with someone else entertaining

653
00:43:51,626 --> 00:43:53,599
for anyway. Real time editing.

654
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,190
Yeah.

655
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:00,227
We could probably make it a
biograf, or we can make a line

656
00:44:00,227 --> 00:44:03,217
graph if you wanna see overlap
of different different skill

657
00:44:03,217 --> 00:44:05,011
sets, I think overlap would be.

658
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:08,658
Be good 'cause I think did I
want some comparison in this

659
00:44:08,658 --> 00:44:09,405
section or not.

660
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:14,130
Yeah.

661
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:17,970
I just find it again.

662
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:24,596
Let's see accurately identified
in branchial groups required

663
00:44:24,596 --> 00:44:30,578
skill sets. South ready that
seem that group situation that

664
00:44:30,578 --> 00:44:32,126
lists are saw.

665
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:39,220
Which Wich?
Hey profile

666
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:46,081
in teams.
Change profile files

667
00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:52,363
and it's called
table for ideal

668
00:44:52,363 --> 00:44:57,504
job go. May just be pretty
much just the top 10.

669
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,540
For the skills.

670
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,607
I'll just consolidated the
programming languages as I said

671
00:45:03,607 --> 00:45:05,059
to just programming languages.

672
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:16,432
But I don't know if that's
any help for.

673
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:25,850
It works.
So the ranking system was that

674
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:29,364
something. Ranking wonder

675
00:45:29,364 --> 00:45:32,488
10 most. I was gonna say.

676
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:37,446
10 being most important to your

677
00:45:37,446 --> 00:45:42,012
ideal job. And one being least
important that makes sense OK,

678
00:45:42,012 --> 00:45:46,796
so it wasn't expired is based on
necessity. I think, OK, so it

679
00:45:46,796 --> 00:45:50,476
wasn't to do with burning
glasses. Most popular skills. It

680
00:45:50,476 --> 00:45:55,260
was to do with what you thought
the industry was looking for for

681
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,700
that job. Yeah, so I've put in.

682
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:02,317
So burning glass has it stop
representations. That's what

683
00:46:02,317 --> 00:46:05,747
we're filling out, and then the
ranking system for each

684
00:46:05,747 --> 00:46:08,491
individual's for your ideal job,
as opposed to.

685
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:13,060
Like for example, graphic
design, I'll go one on one

686
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,425
because it be.

687
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:18,080
Wouldn't be needed to do sub

688
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:21,810
security? That makes sense
otherwise, and other

689
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:24,855
programming programming
languages being 10 'cause you

690
00:46:24,855 --> 00:46:27,030
would need another programming
languages.

691
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,398
Where is the program?

692
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,116
When you say windows in I, I
guess you mean the operating

693
00:46:37,116 --> 00:46:39,867
system. Or yeah, how to open a

694
00:46:39,867 --> 00:46:40,930
window. System.

695
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:46,897
So these are two graphs, yeah,
so the combined together so

696
00:46:46,897 --> 00:46:51,067
it's got top IT skills and
then top generic skills.

697
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:59,790
I'll have to come back to
this 'cause I'm just not

698
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:00,370
getting.

699
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:06,100
When when you go to the burning
glass site, you'll start to work

700
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:10,480
it out. After all, they're all
sort of in demand skills that

701
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,060
are listed on burning glass.

702
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:18,513
OK. I just I just found it hard
to interpret my ideal job across

703
00:47:18,513 --> 00:47:23,076
to the tables. 'cause I don't
know too much about some of it.

704
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:28,640
Um? What time with for example?

705
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,259
You sometimes may work in a
team, but then other times

706
00:47:32,259 --> 00:47:34,249
you might not work in a
team. So is it?

707
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:40,505
It's one of the top skills
required, but how necessary is

708
00:47:40,505 --> 00:47:42,630
it to doing your job?

709
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:47,992
OK, so are you. Are you
ranking it based on what

710
00:47:47,992 --> 00:47:52,312
you what you think the
employer values at at or?

711
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:59,471
Yeah. Something or what
burning glass values added

712
00:47:59,471 --> 00:48:03,272
support popularity what you
value it has.

713
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:04,740
OK.

714
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:08,418
So have you value?

715
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:14,479
Like if I thought that I was
going to need a very good

716
00:48:14,479 --> 00:48:18,286
comprehension of Windows
computers, but not Max then I

717
00:48:18,286 --> 00:48:22,939
would put Windows 10 and Mac
Cicilline. Yeah, or if you

718
00:48:22,939 --> 00:48:28,015
needed a general understanding
you would put a 7 or like you

719
00:48:28,015 --> 00:48:29,284
don't need a?

720
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,067
Like you need another basic
skills, but you don't need to

721
00:48:33,067 --> 00:48:36,037
know absolutely everything about
it. It can drop in value.

722
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:41,480
Getting

723
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:49,279
I prefer the minus
10,000 Adam Yeah.

724
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:54,718
So much I might try that.

725
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,198
Think it might ruin our mark.

726
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:03,310
So, for example, offers you make
it if you double clicks the

727
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:06,370
graph, it changes things like
that to minus 10,000.

728
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:11,240
That's in. I'm just having sex.

729
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:17,860
I thought Daniel Just go just
for person 87654.

730
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:20,980
Yeah, pretty much what do you

731
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:25,282
feel is? I should I can't
member the write something

732
00:49:25,282 --> 00:49:26,164
in the actual.

733
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,820
Teams of how

734
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:35,120
The
corner.

735
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:42,580
Yeah.
Wanted to system as to

736
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,828
how important it is to
your ideal job.

737
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,920
Yeah.

738
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:50,490
Oh

739
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,050
What was the

740
00:49:55,050 --> 00:50:00,223
next Sam? RT project do you like
continued So what? Are we going

741
00:50:00,223 --> 00:50:02,204
to do next for the IT project?

742
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:06,530
They've been recording for 5050
minutes. OK, no, no. The

743
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:08,220
meeting's been gone for 15

744
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:13,212
minutes isn't. Not the meetings
been going for 57 but the

745
00:50:13,212 --> 00:50:15,152
recordings been going for 50.

746
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:18,760
The long run impressed in.

747
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:23,913
I'll just, you know, really
reduce the quality, may be black

748
00:50:23,913 --> 00:50:28,750
and white. So yeah, I take
project continued as in for the

749
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:32,602
next assignment or so. I don't
know what's the next step that

750
00:50:32,602 --> 00:50:36,775
we need to do, or is there
anything that we need to other

751
00:50:36,775 --> 00:50:38,701
people to do or anything like

752
00:50:38,701 --> 00:50:41,985
that? Pretty much got to
describe their product. Yep, at

753
00:50:41,985 --> 00:50:45,235
least the technologies we're
going to use in the product.

754
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,430
I'm.

755
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,878
And then expand on it, really.

756
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,560
Sections from assignment one

757
00:50:54,560 --> 00:51:00,124
yeah. If we had to use GitHub,
but if we just make a word file

758
00:51:00,124 --> 00:51:04,268
in the Ms teams and just edit
edit it as you go, so everyone

759
00:51:04,268 --> 00:51:08,412
can just keep up with it instead
of what. I think we've only got

760
00:51:08,412 --> 00:51:10,484
a stored on GitHub when my done.

761
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:16,022
No way everyone can just add to
it. As soon as I see fit.

762
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:17,314
You have the other groups can

763
00:51:17,314 --> 00:51:20,110
steal their stuff. Yeah.

764
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:27,060
So we're going with idea for
assessment to or yeah.

765
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,585
They probably run still yeah,

766
00:51:29,585 --> 00:51:33,900
yeah, yeah. Unless we
wanna make life harder on

767
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,540
the next two assignments.

768
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:41,042
So when when is this one drew?
How long have we gotta do? We

769
00:51:41,042 --> 00:51:42,582
need to make a plan.

770
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:48,734
Sorry, some groups that haven't
even started yet. I think all we

771
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:54,350
really have is our project idea
in our feedback. Really to go. I

772
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:59,534
mean there is some obviously
some more work to do on some

773
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:05,150
reports and that but the base is
there. We gotta do the interview

774
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,310
on Saturday, the work section,

775
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:11,910
the project. Any follow up to
the interview? Like do we need

776
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:15,991
to describe what we've learned
or talk about, how it's relevant

777
00:52:15,991 --> 00:52:21,556
to us, or do we need to do
anything there? Or is it just an

778
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:26,008
interview for our best days just
to you? And then we write

779
00:52:26,008 --> 00:52:30,460
something about the questions so
we can just a quick thing on

780
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:35,283
that. We do need to summarize at
least 10 YouTube videos or other

781
00:52:35,283 --> 00:52:39,430
web sources. To do that, that's
only if you don't do an

782
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:43,850
interview. I think no, it's a
different one. If you was it, I

783
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:47,930
don't know what that that. Don't
worry, I misread it. So sorry,

784
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,290
sorry to scare everyone.

785
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:53,262
Like 10 videos. I don't know if
I can watch linustechtips that

786
00:52:53,262 --> 00:52:54,917
lot many times it alright.

787
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:03,036
So we need to get the last.
We get the reports done, get the

788
00:53:03,036 --> 00:53:07,662
project description done, and
then make sure all contributing

789
00:53:07,662 --> 00:53:08,690
to get.

790
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:16,633
Stuff. Yep.
What was that him? We gotta do?

791
00:53:16,633 --> 00:53:18,578
Group feedback or something as

792
00:53:18,578 --> 00:53:22,606
well. Group of reflection. After
we've done everything to before,

793
00:53:22,606 --> 00:53:26,646
we submit it, we got to reflect
on our group.

794
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:31,028
Because that other external
site, we gotta do.

795
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:36,746
Set Tim was meant to tell us
about all this we've got to do

796
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:40,630
this. Yeah, that's um, I
think week eight, so I think

797
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:43,807
there might be. After we've
submitted maybe. And then

798
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:46,984
there's the contribution
shape we've got to do as

799
00:53:46,984 --> 00:53:49,808
well. On the PDF, we've
gotta collect everything

800
00:53:49,808 --> 00:53:53,691
onto a PDF. Yeah, yeah, oh,
that's easy. Which we've got

801
00:53:53,691 --> 00:53:56,515
all the individual documents
so we can just.

802
00:53:57,590 --> 00:54:00,710
Oh, got it like go through the
'cause it might look different

803
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:03,830
once it gets to the website.
There might be things added or

804
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:06,950
taken away so we can just copy
and paste from the website.

805
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,682
Pretty much for mine. All I did
was copy and paste from the

806
00:54:10,682 --> 00:54:13,610
website into a Word document.
Yeah, and it kept most of the

807
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:16,538
formatting. I just tided it up
just a tiny little bit. I

808
00:54:16,538 --> 00:54:19,466
thought it looked ship but Tim
is that. It looks great, but.

809
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:25,358
I love morning was screenshots
of the wizard.

810
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:29,798
How's it gonna type out again? I
just hope that looks good on the

811
00:54:29,798 --> 00:54:31,383
website. It can be screenshotted

812
00:54:31,383 --> 00:54:34,900
yeah? So.

813
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:40,018
Yeah, do that again so we just
need to get all of our

814
00:54:40,018 --> 00:54:42,862
individual stuff done by the
next meeting. Basically, yeah,

815
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:46,654
so do you want to everyone can
review each other's work as

816
00:54:46,654 --> 00:54:50,412
well? Yeah yeah, yeah. So like
the industry daughters, someone

817
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:55,182
wants to raise the other persons
or we all do it just to see if

818
00:54:55,182 --> 00:54:59,316
there's any changes that need to
be made or if it's lacking in

819
00:54:59,316 --> 00:55:04,654
somewhere. Yeah, I copied mine
some Ms teams as well so you

820
00:55:04,654 --> 00:55:11,288
can. Hello. I'm
gonna get that that locker and

821
00:55:11,288 --> 00:55:15,080
I'm just gonna circle like
everywhere draw things.

822
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,953
Although I still feel like I
need to add some things to mine.

823
00:55:17,953 --> 00:55:21,268
It's just I wanted to get the
base reports out of the way so I

824
00:55:21,268 --> 00:55:24,141
can look over and add more
stuff. If we had time or with

825
00:55:24,141 --> 00:55:27,235
the way that I said it out. If
you check it out there's just

826
00:55:27,235 --> 00:55:29,887
one file each for each one of
those that is gonna edit.

827
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:35,628
I like cyber security is in the
data folder. If you go to the

828
00:55:35,628 --> 00:55:39,972
web page, it tells you at the
bottom when you've selected it

829
00:55:39,972 --> 00:55:42,506
for location data. IT
technologies IT cybersecurity.

830
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,435
And then you can just edit the
individual ones and this

831
00:55:46,435 --> 00:55:47,760
formatting already in place for

832
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:54,112
you. If you wanna do that, or I
can put do it doesn't bother me.

833
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:58,380
If we need to individually add
out bits and pieces where we

834
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:03,705
where we can just to get you
can. It's up on yeah or even if

835
00:56:03,705 --> 00:56:07,610
it's just like taking your Word
document and committing it to

836
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:11,515
the master branch like into the
individual folders. It's just to

837
00:56:11,515 --> 00:56:15,420
show that you've got an
understanding on how to check in

838
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,195
and check stuff out again.

839
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:19,228
No, go ahead.

840
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:23,830
At 7:30 now, so just go
through and change spelling

841
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:25,242
mistakes 1 by 1.

842
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:28,930
I guess you commit.

843
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:32,473
Commit and then commit, and then
I'll get a check something and I

844
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:33,728
would like *** **** it.

845
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,988
Merge, Merge, Merge Merge

846
00:56:37,988 --> 00:56:42,210
Management. Um? Next
week.

847
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:48,044
This has been a long meeting, we
probably do not need a second

848
00:56:48,044 --> 00:56:52,344
one. We're making up for not
having to meetings last week. I

849
00:56:52,344 --> 00:56:55,688
guess it splits into two it
could classes two meetings this

850
00:56:55,688 --> 00:56:58,958
week, too. Quick stop the
recording and then we'll start

851
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:02,682
it again. And when I upload it.
I'll read ate it and top that

852
00:57:02,682 --> 00:57:04,810
bit off that I just said what we

853
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:08,530
were doing. Do you want me to do
that? Is that possible?

854
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:13,722
Well, George is here now, so
it'll look like this and you

855
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:17,418
meeting. Yeah, except it's gonna
come up in the recording with

856
00:57:17,418 --> 00:57:18,762
the square of George.

857
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:23,185
Hello. Hey welcome, I think he's

858
00:57:23,185 --> 00:57:26,070
microphones on me. Oh yeah.

859
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:31,873
Sorry schedule another meeting
for this week or the weekend or

860
00:57:31,873 --> 00:57:38,355
or we got the interview. Oh yeah
that could be a meeting, but I'm

861
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:43,448
free Sundays also hello. Hey
George, sorry oh. It's all good.

862
00:57:43,448 --> 00:57:47,152
Victorians in their daylight
savings. Yeah, didn't realize

863
00:57:47,152 --> 00:57:49,930
until like run from work OK.

864
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:55,154
We want to perform at least for
next Wednesday at a different

865
00:57:55,154 --> 00:58:02,072
time. Dare. 730 Victorian
time, which will be

866
00:58:02,072 --> 00:58:08,339
630 QLD. Yeah, yeah,
I could just sit there.

867
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:12,168
Five 5:30 WA.

868
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:19,702
4:30. It was 3:30
for me today, so get 6:30

869
00:58:19,702 --> 00:58:24,101
meeting. Do I have time or
savings they used to? I think

870
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:27,962
about 10 years ago maybe. Yeah,
headache that they had this

871
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:30,068
Traglia is its own country now.

872
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,660
Daniel 4:30, right now

873
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,450
over here.

874
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:42,650
Please.
Hello, I just assumed Daniel was

875
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:45,430
in Vic. I thought you were.

876
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:50,036
And then I'm just looking at
your window like Oh, it's bright

877
00:58:50,036 --> 00:58:53,270
out there. So 730

878
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:57,200
Victorian time. OK.

879
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:02,680
Yeah, we can make it later. I
get if I to help in the Wii

880
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,962
people. I don't mind anytime is
good for me works.

881
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,468
I can do 7:30.

882
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:12,186
So it's OK with you George.

883
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:15,785
Yeah, yeah, 7630 your time

884
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:21,350
George. Yeah Yeah, 'cause I
finished at 6 so I still have

885
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:22,550
half an hour.

886
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:29,680
And were all who who
wasn't available for 10:00 AM

887
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:35,408
Saturday. 9:00 AM
Queensland Dollar.

888
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:41,035
Which I don't think is a huge
problem because they essentially

889
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:46,285
said on the assignment that it
had, like if it was an in person

890
00:59:46,285 --> 00:59:49,660
interview, which it obviously
can't be. They recommended two

891
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:53,410
people. Obviously we'd prefer
everyone, but not everyone can

892
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:55,540
attend. I don't think that's a

893
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:59,108
big deal. In person interview
because of all like Melbourne

894
00:59:59,108 --> 01:00:03,380
people were on lock down. I
don't know what it's like in

895
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:07,652
Queensland. No? I mean they just
didn't specify how many of us

896
01:00:07,652 --> 01:00:10,856
had to be attending in the
online interview, Yeah?

897
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:13,885
And spices, there's no
restrictions there. We can do

898
01:00:13,885 --> 01:00:16,900
whatever we want. I had
Westerners generally, is more

899
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:22,010
open. Yeah, but they don't want
to open their borders with

900
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:26,680
anyone. They've always wanted to
be their own country anyway, so

901
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,096
yeah, Queensland following suit
to borders shut easel.

902
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:34,090
Play George Junior. Wanna
Summary of what we've kind of

903
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:38,122
talked about? Or will you re
watch this? Yeah yes please yeah

904
01:00:38,122 --> 01:00:41,482
yeah just a quick to see what
where we are.

905
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:47,656
Sam, did you want to summarize
or I will yeah so first we

906
01:00:47,656 --> 01:00:49,344
discussed about our assignment

907
01:00:49,344 --> 01:00:54,634
results. Ah, yeah, if anyone had
any anything to say about that

908
01:00:54,634 --> 01:01:01,850
so. Yes.
Yeah, my assignment. I thought I

909
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:05,105
was not going to be that very

910
01:01:05,105 --> 01:01:10,641
good. I knew that my IT project
in my my presentation wasn't

911
01:01:10,641 --> 01:01:13,407
going to be that very good.

912
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:19,855
Yeah, but yeah, it was pretty
basic. My presentation so that

913
01:01:19,855 --> 01:01:25,510
really didn't help with my grade
and as well with the IT project

914
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:30,730
as well, I didn't knew too much
what you put in it.

915
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,700
And Yeah, it didn't help,

916
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,967
either. But? Yeah, did you get
any helpful feedback?

917
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:44,360
Yeah, yeah, actually those two
subjects that I just mentioned

918
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:49,959
that's that's what team said to
me, yeah, I didn't elaborate,

919
01:01:49,959 --> 01:01:57,540
too much. I wasn't too
ambitious. Kind of in respect to

920
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,520
the IT project.

921
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:02,306
More help you do more of like a

922
01:02:02,306 --> 01:02:06,086
reset. Yeah, so at least I know

923
01:02:06,086 --> 01:02:08,580
where I. Yeah.

924
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:12,650
You passed. Yeah.

925
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:17,185
What is next time next

926
01:02:17,185 --> 01:02:20,420
time? Look did progress reports,
so how you?

927
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:26,068
IT technology. Papers going in
your team profile as well.

928
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:31,340
Yeah, well, I've done that yeah,
I already finished that.

929
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,425
Yeah, cloud cloud, cloud
computing and yeah, my profile

930
01:02:37,425 --> 01:02:40,455
and everything else is done yet.

931
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:42,188
Did you submit it to the?

932
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:47,140
To the team's been yet.

933
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:52,874
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
OK cool, yeah.

934
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:58,926
And the How did you do
the industry?

935
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:01,620
Dota 1 yet?

936
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:07,475
Ah yeah that one, too, yeah,
it's in the.

937
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:12,440
Uh. Is separate from ideal?
Where is it? I'll get something

938
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,858
get confused with all the steps?

939
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:20,835
It's under industry data George
at your job, yeah, so yeah.

940
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:24,098
Yeah, is there too as well.

941
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:29,998
Also, you don't industry data
and ideal jobs. Yeah, oh cool.

942
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:33,620
So it ahead.

943
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:38,454
We kind of concluded that we
would get all of what you've

944
01:03:38,454 --> 01:03:42,498
just said done by the next
meeting, 'cause not all of us

945
01:03:42,498 --> 01:03:46,879
are there. Yes, so, but the plan
was was to everyone does like

946
01:03:46,879 --> 01:03:50,249
the industry data thing and then
the next meeting will

947
01:03:50,249 --> 01:03:53,619
collaborate and work. It had to
bring it all together.

948
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:58,346
Yeah, that's what I was thinking
too. 'cause Yeah, not until we

949
01:03:58,346 --> 01:04:01,676
all do that. We can start like
yeah, putting everything

950
01:04:01,676 --> 01:04:03,341
together and see how we?

951
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:07,290
Relates to one another.

952
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:10,840
So if if you choose to re
watch this recording,

953
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:14,390
you'll see like kind of
what we tossed around and

954
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:16,520
brainstormed, but
essentially will have will

955
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,715
have to all do our
individual pieces before we

956
01:04:19,715 --> 01:04:21,490
can set anything in stone.

957
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:25,370
Yeah. Harrison

958
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:32,420
Um. George is the ideal job
section of that file you

959
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:34,268
uploaded is that for the ideal.

960
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,626
Is that two documents in one?

961
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:42,104
Oh, so you had the industry data
at the bottom and the ideal job

962
01:04:42,104 --> 01:04:48,524
at the top. Yes, two separate
ones is it? Yeah, two separate

963
01:04:48,524 --> 01:04:54,894
ones. Right then you want me to
put him together. I don't know.

964
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:58,376
And I already together is only
one document there. Yes, that's

965
01:04:58,376 --> 01:05:01,536
the first paragraph looks like.
So ideal job section, yeah?

966
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:08,410
So the there were two topics,
one about industry data and one

967
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:12,055
about our comparing our
individual chosen jobs. So there

968
01:05:12,055 --> 01:05:14,080
they were a bit different.

969
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,978
'cause I've got.

970
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:18,828
It's like this.

971
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:22,963
Industry data. I

972
01:05:22,963 --> 01:05:27,770
did not. IT support
specialist and down the

973
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:30,360
bottom. I had another
sectional. Yeah sorry.

974
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,100
Industry data.

975
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,778
Some, do you want me to
separate it? Yeah no, no.

976
01:05:37,778 --> 01:05:41,000
It's all one document, isn't
it? Yeah, that's All.

977
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:45,983
So it's meant to be 2
separate ones George.

978
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:54,360
Ah, so yours is just in one, so
just separate ideal job into the

979
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:59,365
ideal job section and then I'll
just leave your industry data

980
01:05:59,365 --> 01:06:03,960
paragraph. In there on the site
where I've got a moment.

981
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:08,150
I think if you re watch out,
like what we've talked about. We

982
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:11,030
went over it a few times 'cause
it was a bit complicated.

983
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:15,210
And kind of sussed it out.

984
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,060
OK, yeah, that's all good.

985
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:24,304
That's clear, an Adam too dumb
we wanna talk about potentially

986
01:06:24,304 --> 01:06:30,472
a once. This is once we've all
got our individual stuff done.

987
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:35,170
You offered to help us do some
commits if we're not really sure

988
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:37,690
how to do that in a group

989
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:41,690
setting. Yep. We can't commit to
anything like that just yet. Can

990
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:42,017
we

991
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:47,830
Wait? So
very check that.

992
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:52,477
Said the word Commission to
different circumstances.

993
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:57,895
You said you might be able to
help us a little bit with

994
01:06:57,895 --> 01:07:01,860
learning how to do that if we're
not quite sure you have example

995
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:05,520
another meeting booked after
this. So if you wanna do it, I

996
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:10,095
can give you a walk through and
show you how to do it. Or should

997
01:07:10,095 --> 01:07:11,315
we wait until we've?

998
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:13,726
All of us of each individually

999
01:07:13,726 --> 01:07:16,580
done our pieces. Um?

1000
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:20,328
Have you have you got any
documents on teams that already

1001
01:07:20,328 --> 01:07:21,718
that I finished already or?

1002
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:28,098
Um? Could you probably
wanna timeline of commits rather

1003
01:07:28,098 --> 01:07:31,751
than just a whole heap at the
end? You probably won't say that

1004
01:07:31,751 --> 01:07:35,404
you know you've done a commit On
this date this day. This day,

1005
01:07:35,404 --> 01:07:38,480
this day. Yeah.

1006
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:42,060
So that doesn't look like
OK. We you know everyone

1007
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:45,934
just done one or two at the
last minute to make it look

1008
01:07:45,934 --> 01:07:47,126
like everybody used git.

1009
01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:54,270
My interim personality test is
completed. You can even upload

1010
01:07:54,270 --> 01:08:00,782
unfinished stuff as well because
it will just add the changes

1011
01:08:00,782 --> 01:08:04,334
next time you do another commit.

1012
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:09,461
OK, well I've got one. I've
got at least one finished

1013
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:13,171
file and then I've got one
unfinished file, upload it

1014
01:08:13,171 --> 01:08:17,623
on teams at the moment. So
yeah, yes, so should we wrap

1015
01:08:17,623 --> 01:08:19,478
up and stop the recording.

1016
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:25,425
So, so just confirm what we have
to do for before the next

1017
01:08:25,425 --> 01:08:29,912
meeting so. Everyone needs to
get the burning class burning

1018
01:08:29,912 --> 01:08:31,079
glass data done.

1019
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,740
And finish any reports or
anything or that, yeah, finish

1020
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:37,810
your reports and your profile.

1021
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:41,924
So I've gotta I've gotta
complete my industry data.

1022
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:47,814
And the project summary
basically assessment one stuff.

1023
01:08:47,814 --> 01:08:49,533
Yeah with Daniel.

1024
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:51,420
Yep.

1025
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,108
I'm gonna do my.

1026
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,959
Website my technology.

1027
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:03,316
Yep. Burning glass job

1028
01:09:03,316 --> 01:09:05,870
summary. Yep.

1029
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:14,660
That's pretty much all, and then
we got the interview in between,

1030
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,100
so that'll be good.

1031
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:19,614
So with the with the interviewer
we doing that like what platform

1032
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:23,702
are we doing that on on teams or
that were users teams? We can

1033
01:09:23,702 --> 01:09:27,498
just invite him to the meeting
as a guest arc. It's cool, yeah?

1034
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:33,624
Sweets and then we can use teams
to record it rather than have to

1035
01:09:33,624 --> 01:09:35,529
use something else and yeah.

1036
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:39,158
So should we

1037
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:42,400
He's probably watching is

1038
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:47,611
right now. Should we attempt
to be there a few minutes

1039
01:09:47,611 --> 01:09:48,808
early if possible?

1040
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:57,189
Yeah. 510 minutes early do
mic checks and stuff, yeah.

1041
01:09:58,270 --> 01:09:59,980
And I'll try and make myself

1042
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:06,391
less purple. Well, they can
complain to him about that it's

1043
01:10:06,391 --> 01:10:08,038
teams doing that.

1044
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:14,082
Not. Adjust the computer
to surface surface like Surface

1045
01:10:14,082 --> 01:10:17,076
tablet. You can also blame that

1046
01:10:17,076 --> 01:10:23,288
as well. Is that ragging on it
like this? This is a red jumper

1047
01:10:23,288 --> 01:10:28,496
and it doesn't work now? This is
definitely a red jumper. Now

1048
01:10:28,496 --> 01:10:30,666
it's now it's purple pink.

1049
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:34,050
Yeah, it looks red.

1050
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:39,158
That's just the wall behind you
that's Purple. Oh Oh, let's read

1051
01:10:39,158 --> 01:10:44,044
it looks the same as you jump to
the man is the person that

1052
01:10:44,044 --> 01:10:47,534
painted this rental was. I think
there were couple born.

1053
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:53,291
Our last rental I think was
painted by Hippies or something

1054

yellow dark Brown and bright

1055
01:10:59,022 --> 01:11:01,627
purple bright pink and Apricot.

1056
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:07,536
Well, I like to prove my kids in
is is green on one wall, but it

1057
01:11:07,536 --> 01:11:11,750
looks like they did it with a
sponge for like WAVY lines in it

1058
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:15,362
and then put glitter on it and
then it's pink on the.

1059

01:11:19,206 --> 01:11:23,397
wall. Alright, can you hear me

01:11:23,397 --> 01:11:26,367

The roost cheese. Yeah, they
painted the reflow.

1063
