1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:08,972
Have been ready
so this is

2
00:00:08,972 --> 00:00:12,158
meeting number 66.

3
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,177
Meeting #6, so the first
item on the agenda is any

4
00:00:18,177 --> 00:00:20,873
resolutions to the actions
of the previous meeting.

5
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,313
Do we have anything that
we needed to bring up? I

6
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:26,628
think it was the project.

7
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,013
Was one of the actions for
the last meeting.

8
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:32,450
Yeah.

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,638
Burning glass stuff as
well, yeah.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,002
Which everyone seems to
be OK with the burning

11
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:43,066
glass. Then anyone have
any questions about it?

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,507
Maybe half a can in Laura
Unlikeness.

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,434
The was it Shannon or Sam's
talking to about the burning

14
00:00:55,434 --> 00:00:57,330
glass stuff yesterday about.

15
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,990
I was just for the young.

16
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,190
I know it's terrible.

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,483
So we didn't come up to it. Come
to a conclusion about ranking

18
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:11,887
the titles, did we?

19
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,550
No.

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,129
So we might.

21
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,130
Or I still think.

22
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,080
Um?

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,388
With all the individual tabs we
have for ourselves, its economy

24
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:31,912
gives you like what your job
title is and then and then you

25
00:01:31,912 --> 00:01:36,088
can kind of for mine. I found
how many vacancies there were

26
00:01:36,088 --> 00:01:39,568
available in Australia. I just
don't know whether that would

27
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:41,308
just suit that first line.

28
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,598
So the problem I have was
trying to.

29
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:52,960
Yeah.

30
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,300
Yes, I can't hear anything.

31
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,739
Can you tell who it's
coming from?

32
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:02,870
No.

33
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,178
I said I can probably
incorporated Graffy said

34
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:26,906
with or seen with quick
mind with Daniels.

35
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,120
Gone now.

36
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,410
Yeah, sounds like it. Yeah,
yeah sounds like it. Yeah,

37
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,427
it's already intermittent.

38
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,959
Good morning Daniels and George
is it's kind of.

39
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,954
I I have a value of how much
like Dragon Season Australia.

40
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,570
Sorry. You were coming
out of it.

41
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,998
Is that me that's doing it?

42
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,307
If you're not talking, just
mute your microphone and

43
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:15,599
that'll minimize any noise.

44
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:17,910
Yeah.

45
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,450
Almost switching my hand.

46
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,879
Alright bye bye.

47
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,770
Yeah, so I think the only way I
can be incorporated into a

48
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,740
graph is if everyone could find
like how many job vacancies

49
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,440
available for their specific
job title. And then I could

50
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,060
just do that simple number
thing.

51
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,608
But I don't think it's kind of
necessary as long as everybody

52
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:48,222
in their own individual tab has.

53
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,510
Say how many jobs Alvin?

54
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,200
Tell me.

55
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,141
All that job title are currently
being seeked in Australia. It

56
00:03:57,141 --> 00:03:58,796
should be fine for it.

57
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,840
Title for the requirement.

58
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,856
Is that from burning
glass the vacancies?

59
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,238
Now will the burning glass.
Often it's it only lists other,

60
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:17,134
but I was talking to Mattie
about it. Only lists like that

61
00:04:17,134 --> 00:04:21,695
OPS 17. And a lot of our titles
aren't even that top 17.

62
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:23,930
Doesn't even.

63
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,150
Sorry.

64
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,890
Even the top one only really
represents point 8% of all jobs

65
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,840
that are seeked, so it's.

66
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,535
I'm not too sure where to use

67
00:04:37,535 --> 00:04:42,504
it. For the skills, I think
glass is fine, but for the

68
00:04:42,504 --> 00:04:44,688
titles I couldn't find it
useful.

69
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,626
Yeah, I found that it didn't
actually specify what it was

70
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:55,514
ranking it didn't. It didn't
tell us what was big. It kind of

71
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:59,274
gave Obeid description and then
no vague title and no

72
00:04:59,274 --> 00:05:03,130
description on. What
was being rated 12.

73
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,770
One to 10 or 1 to 7 or
whatever it was.

74
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,790
Yeah, the burning burning glass
stuff was stuff they got from

75
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,810
two years ago.

76
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,117
But to get like the more
comprehensive data, and like the

77
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:20,494
newer data more up-to-date, you
had to pay for it so.

78
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,530
Yeah, I guess we'll never know.

79
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,070
So do we wanna attempt
to help? How how heavy

80
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,798
heavily is it marked?

81
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,786
Because we could, we
could attempt to look up

82
00:05:38,786 --> 00:05:41,792
how many jobs are going
for that specific title.

83
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,170
Which seems like the most.

84
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,688
Likely to given it likely option
to give an answer, but also

85
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:53,636
still not easy to do, so I'm
thinking if it's not rated

86
00:05:53,636 --> 00:05:58,483
highly. Perhaps we could
give a description of why we

87
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,865
can't possibly find that
data accurately.

88
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,920
Thought.

89
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,598
We could just use like
Glassdoor or seek or

90
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:15,942
something and then just do
like a list of how many jobs

91
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,114
there are listed on those
websites.

92
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,070
The criteria for industry
data makes up 10% of the

93
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,972
overall mark.

94
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,178
So for you at least get 5% of.
That would still be alright.

95
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,798
Mostly covered with.

96
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,248
Um? History of early visual
ones are already on the

97
00:06:48,248 --> 00:06:51,506
other tenants. Georges in
mind we all have jobs.

98
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:54,750
Yeah.

99
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,722
I think that might take that
first line, as long as it's

100
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:08,640
listed in Virgil. Say like this
is my job title. This is how

101
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,790
many vacancies Australia, but
she's at the first line that

102
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,940
says. How did the IT bills
required in your skillset rank

103
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,504
in terms of demand?

104
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,680
Yeah, that's The One.

105
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,286
Like the one with before
that, wasn't it?

106
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,148
I'll be back in a set.

107
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,590
No worries.

108
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,180
So.

109
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,530
In terms of demand for
employers.

110
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,680
Thank you, keep going
quiet, Shannon.

111
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,840
It's.

112
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,296
Is Shannon going quiet for
anyone else at times?

113
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,331
I think I think it's just the

114
00:07:58,331 --> 00:08:00,200
connection thing. Yeah.

115
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,834
Sounded OK, no, I could
hear. OK, yeah.

116
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,070
Alright.

117
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,160
Shannon, sorry. There yeah.

118
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,550
I don't know why my.

119
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,988
Is that not too bad now?

120
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,578
I sound like.

121
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,758
That's good, I don't know why my
main volume on my mic just keeps

122
00:08:23,758 --> 00:08:26,117
on automatically adjusting
itself. It's really annoying.

123
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,674
Sorry kids fell off
a bit of furniture.

124
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:32,950
You're right.

125
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,426
He's got a bleeding lip, but
he's gonna sit here with a

126
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:39,966
tissue and you'll be alright.

127
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,326
Sit down and play over
there, right?

128
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:52,310
I'm. With that had each of these
rank in terms of demand from the

129
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,410
employees. That's just referring
to the burning glass data. Hey,

130
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,750
I don't think I don't think it's
any need to go look for some

131
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,470
outside data on that, and I
think it just refers to skills

132
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,330
as well, not the actual job.

133
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,354
Yeah, it's just one of those
burning data. PDF's is how many

134
00:09:10,354 --> 00:09:12,189
yeah blah blah blah yeah.

135
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,442
It changes all the time, so
you know even if we use the

136
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:19,982
burning glass data, it's
not not going to be wrong.

137
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,739
Affecting right yeah?

138
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,440
Yeah. I'm sorry this blaster is,

139
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,810
but is that OK? Yes, one.

140
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,676
Otherwise, will pretty much have
to make your own burning glass

141
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:37,914
starter to answer the question.
I'm OK with you and with like it

142
00:09:37,914 --> 00:09:42,152
if it's only 10%, I don't think
there is really expecting us to

143
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:44,108
do that much work on it.

144
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,690
I think it we've done done
pretty well like so like the.

145
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,028
Graphs on the website.
Yeah, is that you that

146
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:54,988
the Shannon or is it?

147
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,555
Who did the graphs on
their website?

148
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,156
They are all made by put those
together. Yeah, those are really

149
00:10:04,156 --> 00:10:08,500
good. Yeah, you can get little
animations when they first pop

150
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,400
up. You can select each person
as well. It's really cool. It's

151
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,300
just a a library I grabbed off
the Internet, a JavaScript one

152
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,525
that lets us do it, and then
Shannon went through and put the

153
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:25,075
data in it. We at the customize
it a little bit for how we've

154
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:29,300
laid out the site because of how
I put everything into those data

155
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,200
folders to make it easier to
edit so it hasn't ended up.

156
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,973
Yeah, it's just one file that
you need to edit to change the

157
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:40,297
data in the tables.

158
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,388
OK, 'cause I I change mine a
little bit 'cause I didn't know

159
00:10:45,388 --> 00:10:48,848
WhatsApp was then I researched
your business like probably the

160
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,308
most important thing for the
integration officer. So yeah I

161
00:10:52,308 --> 00:10:54,384
change my stats a little bit

162
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:59,942
but. It's pretty much one or two
lines you've gotta change in. I

163
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:04,454
think it's JS graph JS dash
data. It's just and then you'll

164
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:07,086
see all the data plots in that.

165
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,810
Also, stop updating anything.

166
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,336
So he could probably even
show you he's worked it out

167
00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:17,768
quite well.

168
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,169
Yeah, I will have a look
at that later I guess.

169
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,760
So we're moving on now.

170
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,800
Yeah, pretty much covered.

171
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,830
The hell walks.

172
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,855
Search Mark, just keep sending
them for some reason.

173
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,653
Yeah, I think just the
individual tabs were missing.

174
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,844
Adams Maddieson Sam's.
I think at the moment.

175
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,620
Sample text

176
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,410
hi, uh, industry data were

177
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:01,917
missing mine. Anne Marie's ideal
jobs were missing Marys or she

178
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:04,395
wanted. Just put it up and

179
00:12:04,395 --> 00:12:08,120
Samuel. So so my ideal job in.

180
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:13,147
Industry data was sort of
together 'cause I was using the

181
00:12:13,147 --> 00:12:17,514
burning glass data to compare
our jobs. So we've gotta break

182
00:12:17,514 --> 00:12:24,257
him apart. So the ideal job is
just basically copy and paste in

183
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:26,125
summary from assessment one.

184
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,410
And when would you like your
alluc comparison against like

185
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,940
the skill set of the other
team members, chosen jobs?

186
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,176
'cause I thought of doing that
in my burning glass one as

187
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:43,118
well, so I could probably cut
that bit out and put it in the

188
00:12:43,118 --> 00:12:46,648
ideal job one or I think
burning glasses just mostly

189
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:49,825
just against that data, not
against the other team

190
00:12:49,825 --> 00:12:50,178
members.

191
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,770
But it's kind of weird.

192
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,920
Yeah, 'cause I thought the
easiest way to compare a

193
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,330
different positions was taxi.
Use the data 'cause I didn't

194
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,422
really, otherwise I would have
had to research a lot of what

195
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:10,514
your jobs square and stuff. So
it was the most efficient way

196
00:13:10,514 --> 00:13:14,606
for me. I've learned the easiest
way for that is you just

197
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:18,357
research the title and just get
the description or summary of

198
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:22,108
the title. And that's pretty
much everything you need for the

199
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:25,177
ideal job. Like summed up in
like 200 lines.

200
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,518
A summary of Google.

201
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:38,180
All right, we'll move on then to
deliverables and progression

202
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,996
reports of for each person's
been working on.

203
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,069
Anyone wanna start?

204
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,878
So when you say
deliverables, deliverables?

205
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,931
Individual bits that we have to
do so like as not not commits

206
00:13:56,931 --> 00:14:00,054
the total part of what whatever
task assigned yet.

207
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,570
So I think I've besides the
contribution slash group

208
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:09,010
aspect, I think I've done
all of mine. I just need to

209
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,860
put them on the website.

210
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,818
But what you concluded when you
were going through them today?

211
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:15,900
Yeah.

212
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,398
Yeah yeah, OK.

213
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,624
Say I got at least two
to upload.

214
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,960
Website for.

215
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,543
Well, I hope to do some of
it tonight and latest

216
00:14:32,543 --> 00:14:33,449
tomorrow evening.

217
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,217
Girls with covered Samuel with
these deal job are the project

218
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:47,780
that's coming along quite well.
Don't Daniel posted some.

219
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:53,000
Yep, sections of that already
have started plugging away at

220
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,130
some nights. Yes.

221
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,559
I've done like 3 sections out
of out of it and I'm just

222
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:03,075
working on the Descripcion now.
I think I think all my other

223
00:15:03,075 --> 00:15:06,298
content in other parts of
websites all sorted out, so I'm

224
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:09,228
just going to knuckle down and
start working on the

225
00:15:09,228 --> 00:15:09,521
description.

226
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,188
I started to get it done.

227
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:16,360
I think I've done tools and
technologies and then I've

228
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,070
just got to elaborate on
those and then the skills.

229
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,154
Yeah, Yep Yep Yep.

230
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,138
Then that'll be done.

231
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,010
Do we have any? Did we have any
references or was it just the

232
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,870
two? Yeah, I've just got two
references in the motivation I

233
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,770
can I can for some more in there
I'll I'll see should I should I

234
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,630
look for some references to the
like the tools and technology?

235
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,190
Because I'm just going off what

236
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,890
I know. Online.

237
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,325
Yeah Yeah, 'cause I like for
my assessment. One project I

238
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:53,240
gave him no references 'cause
I was just like you're gonna

239
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,625
need this this, this and this
and this yeah.

240
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:57,700
I don't, I don't know.

241
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:03,130
No, I got. I got funny really
good. I was really good on that.

242
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,980
Oh well, thought it out like

243
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,295
quite a low. Yeah, yeah, I think
just having the two references

244
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:15,320
is fine by me. I think there are
you in this time. We really need

245
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,995
a reference as if you're.

246
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,080
Talking about someone else is
work, so someone's done like

247
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,012
research or something. So if you

248
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:26,522
were doing. If you like
providing statistics or

249
00:16:26,522 --> 00:16:29,942
something from privacy breaches
or something as part of your

250
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:34,046
motivation, but you need to cite
that or reference that. So yeah,

251
00:16:34,046 --> 00:16:38,150
I've got two references in the
motivation that I just copy and

252
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,912
pasted for some abstracts and
just squeeze them in. Pretend to

253
00:16:41,912 --> 00:16:42,938
type on that.

254
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,850
Chief something that's not
yours. You need to reference it.

255
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,360
Yeah.

256
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,730
Wait for you something
that's not else.

257
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:01,527
Yeah, yeah, so if you're using
someone else's research or data.

258
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:02,720
Hi.

259
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,210
Or if you're trying to.

260
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,570
Create your own argument or.

261
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,750
Solution using or basing it
on someone elses stuff 'cause

262
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,160
I don't think we need ref
references for the materials

263
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,229
that we used on the website,
I don't think.

264
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,294
I think it depends 'cause I
think they can just look at

265
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,286
where we where. I've grabbed him
from 'cause I was pretty

266
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:29,374
descriptive in those comments.

267
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:32,950
More academic.

268
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,890
I don't think they're gonna
really care if you grab

269
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,116
stuff off Wikipedia and
then reword it.

270
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:42,990
Alright.

271
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,130
Do we want to review
anything that we put on the

272
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,110
site like assessment
criteria wise? Anyones

273
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,440
unsure.

274
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,483
I think if I think of take

275
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:57,578
pretty much over.
I have a question.

276
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,320
Um?

277
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,268
I see that you've put the the
discord link on there. Yeah, we

278
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:09,922
surely want to include that
because they seemed quite

279
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,952
explicit in writing to not.

280
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,306
They didn't want discord because
they wouldn't be able to get the

281
00:18:16,306 --> 00:18:17,458
history of the channel.

282
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,690
Where? We've got the history of
the channel in that in that

283
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,590
archive, so pretty much when you
join a discord server as a user,

284
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,190
you only see the history from
the day that you joined and

285
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,090
forward where on there with the
bot we've got a history from day

286
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,290
zero. So we've got.

287
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,928
All that that they can
actually download keep.

288
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:47,260
Anne. Yeah. Which is why they
wanted us to use teams because

289
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,796
teams doesn't actually delete
anything and they've already

290
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,649
got access to just say
whatever we've been saying.

291
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:54,400
Yes.

292
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,940
The only thing with the
discord archive it it does

293
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,010
have like a comments where we
were looking at the other

294
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,490
other team members websites.

295
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,370
That's market research
though Yeah.

296
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,750
I mean, every few things are I
was like Oh no, I don't know.

297
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,370
We should be saying that in a
professional setting, but

298
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:24,215
well, that's why I put it down
that it was used as an out of

299
00:19:24,215 --> 00:19:26,799
band communications tool for
general discussions of minor

300
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,352
issues that were two minor in
nature to presented a meeting

301
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:32,936
or general feedback and
support amongst team members.

302
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:34,228
An off topic discussions.

303
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:35,760
Just.

304
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,730
Put it in context conversation,

305
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:43,910
yeah? 'cause like I say, you're
developing a game there like

306
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,880
you've got your meetings and
then you've got your like your

307
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,120
one on one meetings again so you
know with other developers and

308
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,630
and like you pass along ideas or
you'll be using like a chat

309
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,330
service to pass along ideas
amongst each other and they

310
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,300
don't necessarily document all
of it. I've got where they can,

311
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,123
they they do. And I'll mention

312
00:20:01,123 --> 00:20:05,428
it in like a ticket. Are you
know, discuss this with with

313
00:20:05,428 --> 00:20:09,212
someone so via email or on
Skype. Here's like a transcript

314
00:20:09,212 --> 00:20:13,684
kind of thing and eventually it
does kind of make it into the

315
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:16,092
the the code vault, so to speak.

316
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,370
'cause no one likes meetings.

317
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:32,072
So we can leave it or we can
take it. Does what people want

318
00:20:32,072 --> 00:20:33,124
to do on that.

319
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,059
I don't mind.

320
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,880
Wasn't sure sure. I'm sure I
read somewhere that they

321
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,428
said they absolutely didn't
want discord, but.

322
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,000
What are red?

323
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,140
Maybe unlike the.

324
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,960
The canvas they posted
something.

325
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,410
On the assessment.

326
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,928
Now find it.

327
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,470
I.

328
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:19,036
Do not use SMS, WhatsApp,
Facebook, we chat, select

329
00:21:19,036 --> 00:21:20,064
discord, etc.

330
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,948
I think it as weather
switch page.

331
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,640
Page 3

332
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,670
face 3.

333
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,897
20 members, so it's .4 on
Page 3 or messaging between

334
00:21:36,897 --> 00:21:40,020
team members should either
use Microsoft Teams or are

335
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,714
most email.

336
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,910
Well.

337
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:59,486
So tonight when to sign in some
point in the event that there

338
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:02,300
are difficulties amongst team
members, other communication

339
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,918
channels have proven to be
insufficient for arbitration and

340
00:22:05,918 --> 00:22:10,742
moderation by army staff. That's
the only reason I bring it up

341
00:22:10,742 --> 00:22:14,762
really. 'cause they seem quite
explicit there, but I'm not

342
00:22:14,762 --> 00:22:19,586
phased if we included. It just
might be a markdown for us.

343
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:21,990
But it might not be.

344
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,259
I don't know because we didn't
really use it as a main thing

345
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:29,777
was kinda just a side thing.

346
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,650
That's why I thought like
whether we include it or not.

347
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,270
They have used teams a lot.

348
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,168
Yeah yeah stop.

349
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,220
Like is there any anything
in discord that you think

350
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,570
should be included?

351
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,958
Well, that's not really
important discord.

352
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,040
Important or not important in
that kind of thing, it's.

353
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,630
If we know anything except for
the Sega, complete for

354
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:07,987
completion, 'cause we're yeah,
feedback based off like website

355
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:11,717
designs were mentioned on there.
Rather than making a full

356
00:23:11,717 --> 00:23:13,955
meeting on it on on teams.

357
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,220
I don't think they wanna go

358
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:22,106
through like. Redial, I mean
like I don't think he's got

359
00:23:22,106 --> 00:23:26,440
all the relevant information,
they only want to. We can ask

360
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,228
him tomorrow.

361
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,710
Ask him. Yeah, told him
last year.

362
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,828
What was next?

363
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,690
That the class if you want.

364
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,330
Yep.

365
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:51,101
And with everyone details so we
can give him that bro.

366
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,940
And everyone's managed to
use GitHub.

367
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:02,900
I'm still struggling. I'm going
to help George after this

368
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,210
meeting with it, so I've got my
document already, sorry.

369
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:12,211
Our kids, when I've looked on
the contributors for the on

370
00:24:12,211 --> 00:24:16,072
the page, there's only four of
us like Adam, Shannon, Daniel

371
00:24:16,072 --> 00:24:19,933
and myself. So if you change
because it's only going to

372
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:22,741
show you the contributors for
the master repo.

373
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,668
So you actually see him all
you've gotta change in the

374
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:32,496
branch, change to one of the
branches or click insight and

375
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:36,324
then it's gonna show you the
contributors and buy based off

376
00:24:36,324 --> 00:24:40,268
their commits. So I guess
give hugs pretty lacking when

377
00:24:40,268 --> 00:24:43,202
you've got multiple branches
going, so I'm gonna really

378
00:24:43,202 --> 00:24:44,506
track tracks to master.

379
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,350
Where was that on the website?
Just out of curiosity?

380
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,390
Yeah.

381
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:53,700
Our tools.

382
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,735
I haven't updated that graph

383
00:24:59,735 --> 00:25:02,390
'cause. I'd be updating
it every day.

384
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,610
Yep, cool.

385
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,800
The the links to the commit
history which will show you the

386
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,120
individual branches and who's

387
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,048
been. Who's been adding what?

388
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:14,550
Yeah.

389
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,591
OK, and I saw your note about

390
00:25:20,591 --> 00:25:23,460
that. Your comment
about it underneath.

391
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:25,930
That was good.

392
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:27,880
Now.

393
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,964
Kids that don't wanna go
to bed, sorry.

394
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,472
I saw your comment
underneath that

395
00:25:37,472 --> 00:25:40,488
contribution graph as
well, Adam, so that was

396
00:25:40,488 --> 00:25:42,373
that was good of you.

397
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,130
Trial doesn't accurately
reflect.

398
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,640
Hell.

399
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:56,930
Yeah.

400
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,968
Stuck in that answer.

401
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,490
I am any other questions, so
we'll move on again.

402
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,920
Were there any deliverables that
we've missed, or are we?

403
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:18,338
Network. Haven't missed any.

404
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,690
No.

405
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,878
Out all traces down if you. If
you haven't submitted something.

406
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,654
I think Adams put a space
on the website for every

407
00:26:32,654 --> 00:26:35,888
question that I've sort of
seen on the spec sheet, so.

408
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,940
Yeah, seems like we covered.

409
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,058
We can do a final run through,
maybe read through the Rubric

410
00:26:43,058 --> 00:26:45,048
on our last meeting or
something in mark ourselves or

411
00:26:45,048 --> 00:26:47,038
something like that and make
sure we don't miss anything.

412
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,320
Then after the Saturday.

413
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:57,550
I'm eating it will be pretty
much just to run through by

414
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,310
everybody through each page,
checking for typos, spelling

415
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:04,450
mistakes, and reporting him to
that the teams page. So I'll go

416
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,520
through and I'll fix the typos.

417
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,160
One big final commit.

418
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,010
Sweet, what do you solve it?
Do we all have to submit a

419
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,970
copy of the report or we all
just ordered one person? I

420
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,610
wasn't sure on that without
end explained it.

421
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,799
I don't know. I haven't read it.

422
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,550
Says that.

423
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,324
One person from the groomer
system, both files.

424
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,842
It's actually a number as a
group test about two falls.

425
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,300
Heidi just one member has to.

426
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,790
A PDF Ms teams info.

427
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,248
And then the actual.

428
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:57,856
Full formatted PDF report
GitHub Page, link to website

429
00:27:57,856 --> 00:27:59,518
version and repository.

430
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,009
And then I think we all
submit a copy of the

431
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:08,250
contribution sheet. I didn't
look at that one either.

432
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:18,590
Yeah.

433
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,080
So moving on, are we?

434
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,420
Checking

435
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:35,640
it's easy to understand, so
you're all good with the logo.

436
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,790
With a group project. Do you
need any help?

437
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:46,066
Description if you wanna have
a read over, you might wanna

438
00:28:46,066 --> 00:28:48,730
reword something 'cause it
probably won't be hard to

439
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,578
judge it up a bit and get a
few more marks. 'cause my

440
00:28:52,578 --> 00:28:53,762
writing is pretty mediocre.

441
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,778
The more eyes on it the better.

442
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,919
You think really?

443
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:04,830
So do you wanna? Once you've
uploaded a more finalized

444
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,998
version, do you wanna just post
in the comments?

445
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,430
Uploaded it.

446
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,822
Files there in Ms teams and it's
on the website for like the

447
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:20,946
three sections that I've done,
so you're welcome just to make

448
00:29:20,946 --> 00:29:24,354
notes straight on that file. In
Ms teams, I mean, you just

449
00:29:24,354 --> 00:29:28,046
change the whole lot. You don't
even have to ask me. You can

450
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:31,738
just do it well. So are you
editing it within Ms teams? Or

451
00:29:31,738 --> 00:29:34,578
you editing it externally and
uploading to Ms teams? Whenever

452
00:29:34,578 --> 00:29:38,838
I change something I do all of
it at once so it's all on the

453
00:29:38,838 --> 00:29:42,530
same version lab. I do the
change the Ms teams file, then I

454
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:47,729
update. The website and I check
a file, a copy of the Ms teams

455
00:29:47,729 --> 00:29:50,270
file in the data section of the

456
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:54,808
Master Branch. So yeah, so
it's, uh, it's always going to

457
00:29:54,808 --> 00:29:58,552
be all up today. OK, so if we
make any changes, you'll

458
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,120
yeah.

459
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:07,132
Yeah, put him on the Ms teams
section of project ideas. 'cause

460
00:30:07,132 --> 00:30:12,724
I I realized when I uploaded an
unfinished version of my IT

461
00:30:12,724 --> 00:30:17,384
technology, I wasn't sure if
anyone had contributed to it.

462
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:22,044
Anyone had typed on it so I
thought Oh well.

463
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:23,790
With the.

464
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,050
I'll put it up with edits where.

465
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,880
OK, I see. But no one had.

466
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,646
Never mind, ignore what I said.

467
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:37,540
Hello.

468
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,430
Ideal industry data cover
that is there any new agenda

469
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:49,597
items that we need to raise
in address today?

470
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,566
When do you wanna do the group

471
00:30:53,566 --> 00:30:58,186
reflection? That's Saturday at
morning and afternoon.

472
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,780
In the last two meetings.

473
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,000
Sarah.

474
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,043
Some people can make the morning
meeting, but not the afternoon

475
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:15,265
meeting. So we'll have to get
their information and whichever

476
00:31:15,265 --> 00:31:19,405
meeting they attend and try and
relay it to the other members.

477
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,819
And then put it on the side.

478
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,815
Sorry, miss you kid, I
was smiling.

479
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,946
So is the is the plan to still
hand it in Sunday, midnight or

480
00:31:33,946 --> 00:31:35,829
are we going to hand it in

481
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:40,240
until? Tuesday, Wednesday, or
just whenever we finished, I

482
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,540
guess. Anthony's kinda hinted
that the you know that we looked

483
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:49,780
on very favorably if it's
limited on the original date

484
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,476
versus the other date.

485
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,995
But they wouldn't confirm if
would get extra marks or not.

486
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,500
Laughing.

487
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:03,478
I think it would be. I don't
think they'll be extra marks,

488
00:32:03,478 --> 00:32:07,537
but at my unprofessional, if
they told us outright then that

489
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:11,596
would give extra months for a
good mood when they're marking

490
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:16,024
it. Yeah, and and and submitting
hours on the due date like

491
00:32:16,024 --> 00:32:20,083
'cause? That's kind of a
weighted scale for the whole the

492
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:24,880
grades they give it to the
class. If we get it first, yeah,

493
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,987
it'll look good.

494
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,900
They can't really Marcus hard
and then them easy if you know

495
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,675
what I mean 'cause then.

496
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,420
Yeah. Yeah.

497
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,655
I'm happy to see it in original

498
00:32:38,655 --> 00:32:42,211
day. I've seen the other sites
that we can find which it

499
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:44,721
doesn't look like many of even
got a website yet.

500
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,919
Are you guys active on the um?

501
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,438
The class discords.

502
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:55,830
No.

503
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,708
Not looked at it at all.

504
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,308
Yeah, it's pretty quiet.
The class discord that

505
00:33:05,308 --> 00:33:06,688
the one I'm on anyway.

506
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,206
I can't think of anything else.

507
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,546
Are we leaving the red push
button on the final submission?

508
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:28,059
Yeah. I think a bit of humor
weight lose us any points.

509
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:32,367
Yeah, should we query to see
if any Anthony or Tim are

510
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:33,085
possibly epileptic?

511
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,070
Before.

512
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,479
With that button.

513
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:45,082
It's not, I think, are in my
table frowned upon. Is killing

514
00:33:45,082 --> 00:33:46,937
it, killing the shooter without?

515
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,368
Come grading time, yeah?

516
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:57,106
Strange yeah. Ask like off
the cuff link now. By the

517
00:33:57,106 --> 00:33:58,276
way, you have liked it.

518
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:06,864
This is a question like do you
have to Kim? Do you think it's

519
00:34:06,864 --> 00:34:10,174
important to take into account
when writing software? If the

520
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:13,815
the user could possibly, you
know, be epileptic and may have

521
00:34:13,815 --> 00:34:18,449
a fit you know. Do you have any
experience in that there but not

522
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:22,090
like so? It's an indirect
question, but to get the answer

523
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,414
out of him, yes.

524
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,590
I could ask if you like.

525
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,149
On the agenda.

526
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,095
Just just don't be flexing
before you ask how you got

527
00:34:37,095 --> 00:34:38,190
a new iPhone.

528
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,428
Can't even use it
all right, why not?

529
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:50,082
Face for it and I'm scared that
I'm going to break it.

530
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,789
Like that, that's not
the right way to Flex.

531
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,688
Try not to.

532
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:00,470
Alright.

533
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,729
Question and answer time.
That's about it. I think

534
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,093
we're pretty much done.

535
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,548
Great. Have any
questions, things?

536
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,781
The kid goes. Do you have a
question doing what do you

537
00:35:18,781 --> 00:35:19,528
wanna ask everybody?

538
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,670
Leah.

539
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,850
No, no, they don't wanna
play yet.

540
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:28,720
Dakota.

541
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,028
Would you like them to play
with your cars?

542
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:40,880
Hey Daniel, you want Daniel to
play with your car?

543
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,070
Over in 10.

544
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,498
Yeah, he wants you to play with

545
00:35:45,498 --> 00:35:47,543
these cars then. What about any

546
00:35:47,543 --> 00:35:51,019
of the others? Anybody
else, Yep.

547
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,748
Apparently everyone's invited.

548
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,838
Alright, so we'll wrap it up.

549
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,038
Bing, at least.

550
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,318
With the PDF report.

551
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,970
So is there any way like we're
gonna bring everything

552
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:12,615
together? So will everyone put
their their contributions on

553
00:36:12,615 --> 00:36:15,045
the word doc or something or?

554
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,352
I was going to work on the
PDF, but I might do it

555
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:24,000
within teams so that you can
have a look as I go.

556
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,406
I was just kind of waiting
for a soul to get out stuff

557
00:36:28,406 --> 00:36:29,132
on the website.

558
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:34,467
And all the finalizing done so
that any spelling mistakes that

559
00:36:34,467 --> 00:36:38,337
we fix will be correct in the
PDF as well.

560
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:45,354
So I think we I do put some
template stuff up for the PDF

561
00:36:45,354 --> 00:36:49,105
fonts images from the website so
they kinda look the same.

562
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,050
As well.

563
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,388
Do I need to make the
background Gray?

564
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,240
Nope.

565
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,805
'cause it might look a
bit weird.

566
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,623
Get wood and it wouldn't
print very well later.

567
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,400
Push button in the PDF.

568
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,659
The push button.

569
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,319
I don't know if you don't say

570
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:20,572
yes. I can try. I could say I
can look into that if we can.

571
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,488
We can't do it. You can't do
much that changes in a

572
00:37:23,488 --> 00:37:25,432
period. I think you can
change your background.

573
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,490
Stop.

574
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,995
You don't need my boy
taken away.

575
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,820
Alright, so we'll finish
the recording.

576
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,430
Good meeting.

577
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:42,760
Yeah.
