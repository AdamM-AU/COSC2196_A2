1
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,470
And we're recording.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,548
Beautiful closes meeting too.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,730
Now you see I probably put a few
agendas on what I thought would

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,790
be pretty good to go through
tonight because of last night we

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,690
got up to. Well, pretty
much got down.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:24,800
Sorry.

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,841
Pretty much got down to the IT
work. IT work part.

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,140
Now laser, although
obviously I see as the main

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,300
marks for the assignment.

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,630
So I see where we pretty
much discussed Adams already

11
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,988
got someone in mind that
murders coming up with

12
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:45,084
questions, so that's pretty
much taken care of.

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,234
So moving down IT
Technologies is something

14
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:52,002
that we should really.

15
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,344
So the way I'm saying it is
what a group of six. We need.

16
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:00,435
Four of those reports, plus
the project idea. So I was

17
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,245
thinking breaking it up into
one person per report, plus

18
00:01:03,245 --> 00:01:05,212
two people on the project I
did.

19
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,118
If that makes sense.

20
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,442
Because each of these reports is
like 1200 words and I think

21
00:01:13,442 --> 00:01:15,794
yeah, one person. Each one is a

22
00:01:15,794 --> 00:01:17,680
bit. There.

23
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,500
Sorry, what did you say saying?

24
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,777
So we have to do for these
reports, but it's the kind of

25
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:32,085
low in terms of word count,
so I think if you have

26
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:35,316
multiple people working on
each report, it's a bit

27
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:36,393
inefficient actually, yeah.

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,723
I'm sorry I can go yeah
of 'em up later after

29
00:01:41,723 --> 00:01:44,547
after I've already done
well on cyber security.

30
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,962
And then, like Maddie said,
she wouldn't want doing

31
00:01:49,962 --> 00:01:50,538
autonomous vehicles.

32
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,119
But then again, I said it's just
a rough draft and said you

33
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,249
import input would be nice
'cause my writing skills are

34
00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:04,005
great. I'm more more than math
and science person. I'm not an

35
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:07,135
English person. Yeah, yeah we
can still collaborate a little

36
00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:10,891
bit to Polish 'em up. So that's
right, I find Alright, Alright,

37
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:12,456
but I repeat similar phrases.

38
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,530
And I go back. I'm like
that's a bit repetitive.

39
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,444
Some, sometimes that's just what
you need on there. Some of these

40
00:02:21,444 --> 00:02:24,708
for the word count yet, but they
are also, there's no lies.

41
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,950
So in the actual.

42
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,286
I don't get that from Oh
yeah, so how will this affect

43
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:36,729
you like it's 300 words so it
is pretty much personalized

44
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:37,981
to one person anyway.

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,056
I would love an electric car.

46
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,318
Not on this call.

47
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,626
To lose any other looking at
those headings, does anyone else

48
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,702
feel like doing any of that?

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,180
I'm thinking.

50
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,990
Like so who was into like
networking and stuff yesterday

51
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,600
someone in wanting to get
involved. Yeah I was getting

52
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,210
into that. Yeah network yeah I
think like clouds, cloud

53
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,542
services and service would be a
good one this if you're into

54
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:14,235
that. Yeah yeah I'll be keen
into that yeah so sorry so we're

55
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,401
going to be working two person.

56
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,414
One person for each report, one
person for example. Yeah and

57
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:25,242
then two for the roof idea, the.

58
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,974
Thing that we're coming up
with? Yeah, OK.

59
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,870
Probably collaborate on the idea
where I'm yeah yeah yeah.

60
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,760
Just talking something
that is in.

61
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,792
No, yeah I'll yeah I can do
that. Clouds and services.

62
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:48,554
So that's yeah, yeah, anyone
have an interest in any of

63
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:49,238
the others?

64
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,810
Might be interested in doing
the Blockchain One.

65
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,330
Yeah, yeah blockchain.

66
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,695
That's cool. Means still
understand more speculation

67
00:04:02,695 --> 00:04:05,710
and stuff on that, so it
might be interesting.

68
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,630
Adam and Dan can start
working on the project idea.

69
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,879
I guess out we obviously
elaborate. Please not doesn't

70
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,684
seem too much either, it's.

71
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,710
But he was in there.

72
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,947
Does anyone have problems
with those or?

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,090
Hello, that works for me.

74
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,200
Alright.

75
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,410
Yeah, so cool.

76
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,450
Anyway, how should we go about
deciding what the project idea

77
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:47,650
will be? Yes, that's all coming
up now is only one think that

78
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,250
their individual idea was.

79
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,659
Obviously good enough
for the project ID.

80
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,893
I don't think mine was too
creative in my most kind of just

81
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:01,840
an app with. Information about.

82
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,430
A wide range of pets on it. It
was mostly just the invention of

83
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,930
an app which isn't too new.

84
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,128
Isn't brilliant idea.

85
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:14,620
What?

86
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,578
Yeah, my sister now.

87
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:25,650
That was super simple. Very
achievable. But yeah, what was

88
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,380
on your app? Daniel? It was
basically just like a notepad

89
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,530
app. Really it was just

90
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,598
ridiculously. Like I don't know,
High School E.

91
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,226
OK, 'cause I don't think we
actually have to make the app in

92
00:05:44,226 --> 00:05:48,879
the next assignment. No,
'cause I was just looking at

93
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,849
which is much is next point
'cause the assessment 3.

94
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,440
Mostly moving on from that

95
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,720
project idea. 50% of the overall
mark of a 40% mark, so.

96
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,044
Like the project audio come
assessment, threes worth pretty

97
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:05,524
much what this entire system

98
00:06:05,524 --> 00:06:07,610
it's worth. Oh yeah.

99
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,076
So we can get find something
half decent this time and at

100
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:14,914
least then we know we're gonna
have to work on income

101
00:06:14,914 --> 00:06:18,110
assessments, right? 'cause we
need artifacts totally.

102
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,772
Oh yeah, something to prove that

103
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:24,198
we've. Tried to create
something.

104
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,904
Like a screenshot or
something like that.

105
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,920
Like a pre pre Alpha
build or something.

106
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,190
So we don't want something
that's too simple that we

107
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,710
can't get the word count
for in their next

108
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,670
assessment, and we don't
want something too

109
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,910
complicated that we can't
really make any artifacts

110
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,710
for, and it still needs to
be original, doesn't it?

111
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,305
In some capacity in some

112
00:06:50,305 --> 00:06:54,008
capacity. Basically, we're not
ripping off an idea that's

113
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:57,539
already existed, so we're not
gonna make like a a GitHub

114
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,749
Clone or a discord clone or
something like that, yeah?

115
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,007
Fortunately, not a canvas
for this phone.

116
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,315
Or is it didn't say no do
that. He just said it would

117
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:08,990
be too complicated.

118
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,888
I mean my idea like 'cause I
wanted to make like a browser

119
00:07:16,888 --> 00:07:20,748
based noise exposure timer for
like workplaces. So use the

120
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:24,994
microphone from your device and
if you're exposed to too much

121
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:26,924
loud noise, it counts down.

122
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,846
And then eventually, if
you're working too much,

123
00:07:29,846 --> 00:07:32,616
it allowed environment. It
tells you you need a rest.

124
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,910
But I'm not sure 'cause my
knowledge isn't that advanced

125
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,353
in building that kind of
stuff. I don't know if it's

126
00:07:40,353 --> 00:07:41,605
too ambitious or not.

127
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,900
Like we have to learn

128
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,330
JavaScript. You know how do
you know? Put like access the

129
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,050
microphone in a web browser
and all that kind of stuff. So

130
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,460
and then would have to stream
the audio to whatever server

131
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,490
that we're going to set up to
listen to it, to check the

132
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,210
decibel limit. I don't think
it needs to use a server just

133
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,760
like text this straight up.

134
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,476
Straight up information from
the microphone and counts

135
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:13,496
down on a timer like just on
the web browser.

136
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,814
But I'm not really too sure
about that much of that back

137
00:08:18,814 --> 00:08:19,765
end stuff either.

138
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:25,844
It would just need to detect
when it would need to record or

139
00:08:25,844 --> 00:08:28,548
store. It does store through
like a timer.

140
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,853
But when you refresh the
page, it'll be be gone. OK,

141
00:08:33,853 --> 00:08:37,406
I've got won't store data
for a long period of time.

142
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,740
What did you have Adam?

143
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:47,426
I I have a like a timebank kind
of thing. Basically people

144
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:51,804
exchange skills for time and
then so they can get somebody

145
00:08:51,804 --> 00:08:56,580
else to do something like know
your lawn or somebody fixes your

146
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,356
computer. They do trade one hour
time to do that which then.

147
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,717
The person that fixed your
computer gets an hour. They can

148
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:11,481
then say given out or somebody
else to cut their lawn, for

149
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:15,054
example. So Anon dollar currency
based exchange site visit

150
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:19,024
bartercard back in the day or
something. Yeah or skill

151
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:22,597
something or other airtasker or
similar out go on.

152
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,920
Go on. But without money, yeah.

153
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,780
So like replicate trade system

154
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,660
used in. Old time.

155
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,170
System basically, except your
instead of saying I'm going to

156
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,940
give you a goat for 10 chickens.
It's like I think you an hour of

157
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,802
my time and exchange for
whatever service you can.

158
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,660
Give me in return.

159
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,140
OK.

160
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:53,990
Go.

161
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,894
Sorry, I got a kid in here.

162
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,360
I shut the door.

163
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,920
Can chickens?

164
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,060
For.

165
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,340
Mine was like a stocktake app.

166
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,910
I don't know if you ever done
like Stocktake you use one of

167
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,240
those like arifi scanners. The
portable barcode scanners, yeah,

168
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,460
but you use your phone instead.

169
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,140
That would be pretty easy.

170
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,871
Yeah, 'cause they've
already got a barcode

171
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:38,095
scanner software built into
Android. Yeah, I was

172
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,722
thinking about like a QR
code or something, but

173
00:10:41,722 --> 00:10:46,558
that's as far as I can get
like I need to research

174
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:50,588
more of like on programming
and how it will work.

175
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,820
So what what sort of what sort
of person or situation or

176
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,600
workplace would use that?

177
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,638
Supermarkets, yeah 'cause.

178
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:10,166
They're like $2000.00 each you
know. So if you can just like

179
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:15,248
get it on your app, everybody
has a phone so I say so broad

180
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:16,700
yes yeah yeah cool.

181
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,600
Doesn't sound too bad.

182
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,770
I wish I had more information

183
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,210
on. How to do these things?

184
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,820
Of course you could take.

185
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,829
Does it? Does it specifically
have to be like software or

186
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:44,435
something we have to develop? Or
could it be like a it can be

187
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:48,383
something we can make, like a
robot or something if we wanted

188
00:11:48,383 --> 00:11:52,331
it like it couldn't be like her
like an auxiliary sort of

189
00:11:52,331 --> 00:11:55,950
service. They go along with and
already made app or something.

190
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,370
Maybe not really bad idea.

191
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,870
North not could be.

192
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,740
Um?

193
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,910
It wasn't anything that said
it couldn't do that. Couldn't

194
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,174
be an auxiliary service.

195
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,718
Did you have something in mind?

196
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,010
Source.

197
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,998
I was just trying to think of
like is your ideas we could make

198
00:12:23,998 --> 00:12:27,534
if if the problem is like most
of us don't have the technical.

199
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,918
Skills to come up with something

200
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:33,102
maybe? Something a little
bit less technical, but I

201
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:36,450
think the idea is more that
we if we do have something

202
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,240
technical that we have to
research it. So we learned.

203
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,184
So maybe we should come from the
perspective of 'cause it

204
00:12:46,184 --> 00:12:50,024
originally we had to solve a
problem? Or didn't we?

205
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,500
Yeah.

206
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:58,174
Slash my idea. Yeah, however,
major and minor. the IT had sold

207
00:12:58,174 --> 00:13:00,988
problem. I think it had to be.

208
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,410
Somewhat original.

209
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,860
So should we think of
problems first or stem off

210
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,990
of what we've already got?

211
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:14,920
Good question.

212
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,140
Do we have to pick one of the
ideas that we already came up

213
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,020
with an assessment one?

214
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,818
Yeah, we can choose an entire
new one. Yes, even assessment

215
00:13:25,818 --> 00:13:29,096
three it says, been picking
entire new one, so we're not

216
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:31,778
happy with your idea
assessment too. We can just

217
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,566
scrap it and go again, OK?

218
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,462
Yeah. We could just say that
we want to write an app that

219
00:13:39,462 --> 00:13:41,991
checks your privacy settings
on your social media sites.

220
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,444
Sounds like something that
should already exist, right?

221
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,222
A double check privacy on and
then it's even further down the

222
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:57,682
check processing all your apps
on your phone. Yeah, actual

223
00:13:57,682 --> 00:14:01,142
things accepted that aren't
meant to be, which there be

224
00:14:01,142 --> 00:14:04,602
privacy issues with say Facebook
allowing a privacy checking up

225
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:07,370
to look at someone's privacy
settings within Facebook.

226
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,210
If not, if the user gives
it permission to do so.

227
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:13,900
It's.

228
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,646
Seattle basically be logging in
under their name, having to look

229
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:19,990
around except in code.

230
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:25,794
Mexican tile install it never
like OK I want to authorize it

231
00:14:25,794 --> 00:14:28,917
to access Facebook, Twitter,
Instagram, Snapchat and check my

232
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:32,387
privacy settings and then adjust
them or give me recommendations

233
00:14:32,387 --> 00:14:34,469
on what I have to change.

234
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,085
Privacy is a concern for people
at the moment, especially with.

235
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:46,680
Like tik T.O.K going being
banned at right now today?

236
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,830
Again.

237
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,095
Yeah, yeah, sounds like a

238
00:14:52,095 --> 00:14:53,988
naughty. And work on that.

239
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,648
I'm happy with that.

240
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,805
Yep. OK 'cause man gives us a
general idea on the 1st on the

241
00:15:01,805 --> 00:15:04,720
assessment to weaken right?
You know it can be for the

242
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,635
Facebook and all then. Then we
can further elaborate with the

243
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:11,345
plans in the future of what it
can do magic and turn it into

244
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:13,995
an entire security system for
your phone and stuff. Yeah?

245
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,494
Story of what her we will
progress. I don't think we

246
00:15:20,494 --> 00:15:23,834
have to progress it much
further than like an initial

247
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:25,170
stage. It's just a.

248
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,696
He is 4 port is PS4 pages of
what we're gonna do?

249
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:36,372
We could bounce that idea, often
Tim on Thursday and Stephanie.

250
00:15:36,372 --> 00:15:37,980
He has any advice.

251
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,669
Just don't wear.

252
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:47,026
Session with him rather than the
group thing in case other people

253
00:15:47,026 --> 00:15:50,640
haven't thought of an idea that
they want to go with you. Yeah,

254
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,698
yeah, yeah, probably a good
chance with just a simple email

255
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:55,088
through him should be fine.

256
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:03,104
Over. The next week, teams come
up with this new app. Check your

257
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:04,460
privacy. Another $10.

258
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,797
Now that sounds good, so
I'm fine.

259
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,800
Yeah. Yeah it does that soon.

260
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,372
As I just thought this whole
choosing a project would take a

261
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:21,277
lot longer time, no idea.

262
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,599
But when she got one, so
it's good. I think everyone

263
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,200
just had good ideas, so it's
hard to pick.

264
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,640
Like how do we do that? Or is
that too simple or is that too

265
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,570
complex? But the best bit
about doing an app as we

266
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,435
just do a mock up.

267
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,000
Like in Russia.

268
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,221
And say, Well, this is what we
researched. We can you know we

269
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:51,938
looked in how would connect with
Facebook or say Twitter 'cause

270
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:56,310
we don't have to? Look into a
mall just a couple to say that

271
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,140
we've researched it and like
possibly how will do it.

272
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,054
But we never have to
deliver functional Apple.

273
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,682
I think we need to say how it's
going to be feasible if it's

274
00:17:06,682 --> 00:17:07,720
going to make money or not.

275
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,980
Yeah, I think people would pay
for it if it was like if it was

276
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,322
an automated system which would
have to be I think, and it could

277
00:17:18,322 --> 00:17:19,324
easily be couldn't.

278
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,400
Do I just put at the end that we
plan on selling the app to

279
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,500
another company that wants it?
Because I don't have it.

280
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,406
But even if I, even if like it,

281
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:33,590
cost me. If it cost me $2 to
download an app that

282
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,182
automatically like I gave
permission to check all my

283
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:37,910
security, that's an income,
isn't it?

284
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,010
That's if you had to do it,
or selling it, or like we

285
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,350
wouldn't really want to do
ads on a security.

286
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,310
Would we? No.

287
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,097
Defeat the purpose of the
privacy protection.

288
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,190
Then there's the option of

289
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,008
subscriptions. Facebook
would probably buy it so

290
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:00,160
it doesn't get released.

291
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,976
We accidentally leaked the
source code.

292
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,826
The check clears just calling in
and its security is just. It's

293
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:16,324
so easy to write about 'cause
there's so many problems. So

294
00:18:16,324 --> 00:18:17,914
many ways to fix it.

295
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,842
So yeah, that seems like it's,
uh, yeah, pretty easy to attack

296
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:27,275
that project idea cool. And if
we don't like it, we can always

297
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:31,026
change it for the next one.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah, Alright.

298
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:34,777
So this would be a good one is
like a concept.

299
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,684
Research anyway. Alright, so
we're at 20 almost 29

300
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:42,100
minutes, so we've got a
little bit longer.

301
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,640
Started.

302
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,096
From 5 two, I don't think I
don't know that no, we've

303
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:52,602
been recording for 28 almost
29 minutes.

304
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,436
Is that what you think?
That's yeah, I'm not

305
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,156
too sure that they can.

306
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,857
The recording actually started
from like a 5 minute point and

307
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:08,124
I'm just getting news on. Are
the cameras from when the

308
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:10,608
meeting started. Like
when players.

309
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,239
So I think we've only
been recording for 20.

310
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,020
Alright then, going off 'cause
I've got a little recording

311
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,855
thing saying. Madeline
Dupree started recording and

312
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:24,280
then it's got a timer.

313
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,140
The last one was only 38
minutes or something. The

314
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,460
last video file. OK, 'cause
it was definitely like 44

315
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,780
minutes. Yeah, when they've
been here for 24 minutes, so.

316
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,250
He started recording this
right here based off of what

317
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,093
you've got them.

318
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,646
So we've got a GitHub setup by
Daniel as well. Yeah, was that

319
00:19:46,646 --> 00:19:50,390
OK? Did that. Yeah, that's fine.
Yeah, we need to make one

320
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,134
adjustment to it for the GitHub
pages. I don't know if you

321
00:19:54,134 --> 00:19:57,566
notice that I did a separate
branch block server branch in

322
00:19:57,566 --> 00:19:59,750
there for the website, so if we

323
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,736
can. GitHub pages at that all
the web code will go into that

324
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:07,192
branch and then anything you
guys want to submit to the repo

325
00:20:07,192 --> 00:20:08,344
can go in default.

326
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,370
In the Master Branch.

327
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,078
'cause it will keep
them separated when you

328
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:15,158
check in and check out.

329
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:22,292
But it's basically just give
you 2 places to upload files

330
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:27,512
to. Yes I using GitHub
desktop or the Atom editor.

331
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,677
I was using Adam for the code,
but I was using GitHub desktop

332
00:20:32,677 --> 00:20:36,174
as well, but right now I've
got it up in the web browser.

333
00:20:36,174 --> 00:20:40,209
Yeah, well if you if you go on
and it should be a little like

334
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:43,706
a drop down menu there where
it says master if you click in

335
00:20:43,706 --> 00:20:46,396
there you'll see the other
branch its website. Yep Yep.

336
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:52,379
Yeah, sorry. Oh no, sorry yeah,
did you want the website to be

337
00:20:52,379 --> 00:20:57,754
default? Anna I want oh I'll
talk to you later about how to

338
00:20:57,754 --> 00:21:01,424
change the settings for the
GitHub pages settings on the

339
00:21:01,424 --> 00:21:04,727
repo. Yeah, no worries, 'cause
I'll leave master's default

340
00:21:04,727 --> 00:21:08,764
because that's the one it will
select when anybody adds the

341
00:21:08,764 --> 00:21:10,599
repo to say GitHub Desktop.

342
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,742
Oh yeah, cool. So with the

343
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:19,441
GitHub pages. Which one did
you want website obviously

344
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:20,347
website. Yeah.

345
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,344
And if you could just post this
thing, you are out for that. So

346
00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:29,160
on my testing we can see the
code once it's up.

347
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,320
Yep.

348
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,963
Uh, I think I just did it so
it'll work once you've gotten

349
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,287
index stop HTML file.

350
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,336
And I think once everything is
done for the assignment, we've

351
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:47,480
all got to click the fork button
on that repost of each. Got a

352
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,256
copy in our own GitHub accounts.

353
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,160
Yep.

354
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:53,670
Yeah.

355
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,690
Going to upload anything, I'll
probably need some help with.

356
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,724
Everything you just said 'cause
I only understood half of it. I

357
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:06,994
think we can share desktop in
meetings that we could.

358
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,656
Oh yeah, tutorial at some
stage if you want.

359
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,566
Maybe recorded one, probably
not what something we need

360
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:16,508
to submit though.

361
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,638
Hi, fair enough.

362
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,420
Sweet.

363
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,110
Girls, I think that's pretty
much all the agenda was

364
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,619
needed. I did forget to say
we had decided name for

365
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:34,809
anyone I didn't see. We had
to fight the fighting.

366
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:36,640
I'm.

367
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,290
Did I do that?

368
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:42,980
Yeah.

369
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:44,880
1.

370
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,460
I didn't do that wrong, you know

371
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,420
no. OK, that's good. Yeah no,
sorry it's just a cool name that

372
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,900
is told us not to have one that
was too edgy because it might

373
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,820
come back to haunt is yeah.

374
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,850
It's got sharp teeth. That's
really edgy though. Did we

375
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,138
almost won that name?

376
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,764
I just woke up this morning and
it was there, but I'm unclear.

377
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,024
If anyone objects, we
can work something out.

378
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,538
Anyone object to it?

379
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,258
No, I'm cool with that, cool.

380
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,702
Was there anything from
yesterday that we haven't

381
00:23:29,702 --> 00:23:30,854
gotten to Shannon?

382
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,908
Not too sure.

383
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,190
Going through those, I just

384
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,090
looking at. The.

385
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,030
The days we want to make me at
meet up. Yeah that was the next

386
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,794
thing on the agenda at the end

387
00:23:46,794 --> 00:23:51,043
here. I just wanna double check
first Adam and Daniel. You want

388
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:52,801
to start on that project idea.

389
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,340
This week I'm not too sure
how we're going to split

390
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,200
that. They usually do some
content of it anyway and just

391
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,800
upload some drafts and then
we can collaborate on it.

392
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,020
Yes.

393
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,658
Adwaita divvied up.

394
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:13,435
Yeah we can all help each other
with it as well, but I I guess

395
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:15,061
you two would like the Main.

396
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,870
Main leaders in that section.

397
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,383
So if anyone has any, like
any advice or information on

398
00:24:21,383 --> 00:24:24,539
any of the other topics we
should be able to share, I

399
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:27,169
think yeah, yeah I don't
have a problem for asking

400
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:30,325
for help when I get stuck,
so I'll I'll scream out when

401
00:24:30,325 --> 00:24:31,903
I don't know what I'm doing.

402
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,434
It says there's no word limit,
but you know it says it's a

403
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,414
usual 1500 minimum, so same as
assessment one really destroying

404
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:41,904
a new program into it.

405
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,260
OK.

406
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,132
Right about others you

407
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:50,866
motivation descriptions. Yeah,
but now for this assessment I

408
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:54,682
guess. What did you say, Adam? I
was just checking if I

409
00:24:54,682 --> 00:24:57,544
definitely going with the
privacy app for now, OK?

410
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:58,700
No.

411
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,410
Yeah, I think it might help you
if you like.

412
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,928
Face your face, your wordings or
base your topics off of the

413
00:25:09,928 --> 00:25:11,080
previous assessment questions.

414
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,390
Yeah.

415
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,195
That might help you out a bit.

416
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,740
So yeah.

417
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,801
Motivation description the
other one would be the tools

418
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:25,638
and tech skills.

419
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,900
And the outcome?

420
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,750
Or a mix of age depending
whatever you want to.

421
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,573
And then it was pretty much all.
The only other thing that again

422
00:25:38,573 --> 00:25:41,105
and I was just looking in
meeting times. I'm not too sure

423
00:25:41,105 --> 00:25:42,160
whether everyone is happy with

424
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,190
the Saturday Sunday. Well,
I've one preferred during

425
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,776
the week and next weekend.
I'm pretty busy so I won't

426
00:25:48,776 --> 00:25:52,036
be able to meet unless
it's early in the morning.

427
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,880
So.

428
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:59,243
Wait, we got meetings on
Tuesdays and Thursdays. If do we

429
00:25:59,243 --> 00:26:02,879
all watch teams meetings or do
some of us watch other ones?

430
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,436
I just want things yeah yeah,
just watch teams too. I

431
00:26:08,436 --> 00:26:12,572
really get a chance to watch
it live 'cause I'm usually

432
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:13,700
working or something.

433
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,309
I want that runs the main one.

434
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,500
I say.

435
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,254
I don't know whoever it was. I
didn't mind his because we were

436
00:26:23,254 --> 00:26:24,244
traveling in the whole time.

437
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:30,724
But for this week I watch
at East Class. I watched

438
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:34,264
the Anthony's class this
week, and then I kind of

439
00:26:34,264 --> 00:26:35,680
skimmed over teams one.

440
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,790
So I'll go on everyday Monday
through Thursday. 'cause about

441
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:44,690
programming Monday, Wednesday.
But as I said, you welcome my

442
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:49,370
tree watch those just mainly
the class ones. I like to be

443
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:52,100
involved with, which will be
Wednesday, Thursday.

444
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,804
But the Wednesday ones, at 8:00
o'clock in the Thursday ones,

445
00:26:56,804 --> 00:26:59,200
obviously. With you guys
anyway so.

446
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,050
The car caught car course. Wide
ones aren't too intriguing.

447
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,486
And I can always be reached
later 'cause there's no really

448
00:27:08,486 --> 00:27:11,240
feedback like input that you
anyone gives through Adam.

449
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,026
Do you think it's a draw on the
white board if you don't attend?

450
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,620
Alright.

451
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:19,620
Yes.

452
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,012
No, you don't have. There was
pictures of Homer. There were *

453
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:29,396
**** **** getting drawn with
getting called a racist.

454
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,418
Very turned off chat.

455
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:37,360
I didn't want the programming
one during that entire lecture.

456
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,559
I had it in the background, but
I was just doing my programming

457
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,528
assignment during it.

458
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,640
So.

459
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,640
So your.

460
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,708
Shannon, you're you're what
days are you available?

461
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,560
So I need any day.

462
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:01,182
Well, first, I wouldn't be the
same Wednesday I got one at 8:00

463
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:02,214
o'clock at night.

464
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,637
So are you available Wednesday
or not available Wednesday?

465
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,292
I'm available Wednesday before
8:00 o'clock, but I've gotta

466
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:14,680
go to the class. Went at 8:00
o'clock. OK, so you're

467
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,144
available everyday but
Thursday at around six 6:30.

468
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,774
And George, what days
are you not available?

469
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:28,749
Now I'm pretty I'm available by
basically every day I finish

470
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,323
work at 6 and I have.

471
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:37,727
Wednesday Thursdays off so I can
hear any day after 6:30 I'll be

472
00:28:37,727 --> 00:28:40,450
fine and Sam, what does he not

473
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:45,300
available? So my schedule is
always changing, but if I know

474
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,200
like a regular time from.

475
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:54,640
Next week I can adjust, but this
week I'm not available Tuesday,

476
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,920
Thursday, and Saturday Sunday.

477
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,700
So Adam, are you available

478
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,540
Wednesday, yeah. And Daniel.

479
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,610
This weekend I'm OK anytime.

480
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:12,645
What did you say Adam about the
weekend Obvia Way on site this

481
00:29:12,645 --> 00:29:14,520
weekend for three days Friday,

482
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,756
Saturday, Sunday. So Wednesday

483
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,318
6:30. Yeah, that's good.

484
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,997
Good to me, yeah. Sorry I
took over a bit channel.

485
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:27,448
I don't know.

486
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,030
And then the other one.

487
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:31,980
Oh yeah.

488
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:41,494
So. There was Monday and
some available on Friday.

489
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,730
Is everyone available on Friday?

490
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:45,908
Except for Adam.

491
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,490
Oh yeah.

492
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:52,818
What about Monday? I mean that's
that's tomorrow, but it's a.

493
00:29:52,818 --> 00:29:57,234
It's a bit weird having the
meeting three days in a row,

494
00:29:57,234 --> 00:29:59,810
Yeah, but in future we could do

495
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:04,230
Monday. Like from the next week
onwards. And yeah, it's yeah

496
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:09,006
it's OK just to just so we meet
the two meeting criteria.

497
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:15,865
So I've got. I've got cheese day
then anyone not available

498
00:30:15,865 --> 00:30:20,000
Tuesday. I don't have to re
check my schedule for Tuesday,

499
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,960
but we can maybe work around it.

500
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,234
And it is OK if we have absences

501
00:30:25,234 --> 00:30:29,331
as well. Yeah, yeah, that's a
good point next week, probably

502
00:30:29,331 --> 00:30:32,521
Wednesday. And then the
following. Wait, we can do two

503
00:30:32,521 --> 00:30:36,349
from there. Tim did say that
even this week that doing the

504
00:30:36,349 --> 00:30:37,625
two meetings a week

505
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,360
that cause groups still
forming wasn't a real

506
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,820
necessity. OK, so Wednesday.

507
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,648
I will start their wakes from
the Sunday, so this account as

508
00:30:48,648 --> 00:30:50,418
well on my phone so.

509
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,658
So maybe a Friday?

510
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,818
Cool. OK, so Wednesday and
maybe Friday.

511
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:08,185
Sorry, sorry, sorry so Wednesday
and Wednesday and Friday.

512
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,890
Definitely Wednesday
maybe Friday.

513
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,639
Is it 1 Fraser in the
afternoon at all?

514
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,550
Most days.

515
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:26,160
Yeah, most days, but Wednesday
Friday every other day again.

516
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,756
Pretty much after one every
day I'm available.

517
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,130
OK.

518
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,292
So I guess for now we can look
in Wednesday 6:30 yeah?

519
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,360
Yep.

520
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,410
Schedule that.

521
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,166
And you want to do that, like is
like a regular like session each

522
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:55,329
week, so we have at least one.

523
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,670
Wednesday 6:30 should be just a
regular one weekend, yeah?

524
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,160
Cool.

525
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,100
For this one, one day a week,
you know report.

526
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,630
Can you have a second meeting?

527
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,778
Another side we need to, but.

528
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,867
The second meeting can
display other name.

529
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,702
I don't know the best way to
say that it can be called a

530
00:32:24,702 --> 00:32:25,266
point if necessary.

531
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,260
Yep.

532
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:34,078
So was there anything on my?

533
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,599
Are the actions from this
meeting come up with the team

534
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:41,311
name done right out of
paragraph of personal

535
00:32:41,311 --> 00:32:42,667
information to combine later?

536
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:48,778
So we just need to do that
individually. Each write out

537
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:51,910
three personality test outcomes
and descendants on how this

538
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:55,390
information may be helpful to
the group and individual task.

539
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,218
Write a quick summary of our
ideal jobs. We've covered that.

540
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,515
Find the next meeting covered
that collect the list of group

541
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:05,670
websites covered that.

542
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,846
Create a GitHub repository.
We've done that. Discuss

543
00:33:10,846 --> 00:33:11,880
three things.

544
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,620
Discuss these things for the.

545
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,410
Our meeting we've done that.

546
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,060
Come up with some questions for
Is It Steven or Stephen?

547
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:25,530
Adam.

548
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:29,840
Thursday.

549
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,180
Steven

550
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,900
is probably Steven.

551
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:42,211
Covered everything, do we
need to? Do we want to like

552
00:33:42,211 --> 00:33:45,321
planned out something to talk
about next time? And who

553
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:46,876
wants to share next time?

554
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,008
I'm just about the actions of

555
00:33:50,008 --> 00:33:53,855
the meeting. This meeting will
just talk about as we've gone

556
00:33:53,855 --> 00:33:56,915
through, and I've just put in
there prior to. This is just

557
00:33:56,915 --> 00:33:59,720
next week, will just be at the
moment we have progress.

558
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,780
Report of all the content that
was. So since we're going to

559
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,585
Wednesday, I'm not too sure
how free people, but if we

560
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,880
start uploading those
documents and then we can see

561
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,155
where we're at with that.

562
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,248
I think we got the majority
of the basics covered now.

563
00:34:13,248 --> 00:34:16,196
It's just a matter of trying
to get content in, yeah?

564
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,000
The other thing was like the.

565
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,876
We were supposed to come
each of us with one question

566
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:26,060
for him for Steven.

567
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,153
Do we just add the questions?
Just type the questions into

568
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:35,420
the word file that we have
there in teams.

569
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:39,478
Yeah Yep OK cool.

570
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,009
And did we?

571
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,620
I was gonna say.

572
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,230
I'm just trying to find out.

573
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,858
Search direction next time.
We might talk about any

574
00:35:01,858 --> 00:35:06,376
questions we have about the
individual staff or any

575
00:35:06,376 --> 00:35:10,392
questions following the class
meetings that from Anthony.

576
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,280
I just kind of talk through any
any problems we might be having.

577
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:19,518
Going to look like.

578
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:25,526
Yeah, and like if you
might have some.

579
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,249
We might have feedback from
their assignments, but into

580
00:35:29,249 --> 00:35:30,152
the first assessments.

581
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:34,370
And like with with the app,
we might you might have some

582
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:37,010
questions about how sort of
how that's going to look or

583
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,890
how that's going to work, and
it would be good to talk

584
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,290
about that as a group, 'cause
it's kind of A.

585
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,440
I think intellectually it's
a bit of a bigger task than

586
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,310
the full report.

587
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,736
Coming up with the idea and
how it's all gonna workout,

588
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:53,816
it's a bit more creative.

589
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,976
So we could discuss
that on Wednesday.

590
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:01,710
Up

591
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,180
not sure what else we need
to talk about that.

592
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:10,920
The team.

593
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,090
No.

594
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,490
Not project.

595
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:20,880
**** the.

596
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:26,370
Spark plus, by the time you get
to workout is that an individual

597
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,650
thing. The spark plus.

598
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,080
Rolling survey

599
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,740
their individual, did you say?

600
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,058
Yeah, I asked him about it last

601
00:36:38,058 --> 00:36:41,990
meeting thing. Last Thursday and
he said not to worry about it.

602
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:45,532
They'll let us know it might be
after we submit it like after we

603
00:36:45,532 --> 00:36:48,315
submit the assignment to or
might be before that. He said

604
00:36:48,315 --> 00:36:50,339
he'll let us know in a couple of

605
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:53,508
weeks. Cool, I said vague.

606
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:58,411
Maybe we will have more stuff to
talk about by the time Wednesday

607
00:36:58,411 --> 00:36:59,519
comes around on Wednesday.

608
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,356
I want to say it's gonna
look like.

609
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,560
All like style yeah, what
do you want to look like?

610
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,340
A.

611
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,870
I I don't mind it.

612
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:14,128
Just nice and easy and
functional.

613
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,610
And in particular coverages one.

614
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,230
Bright pink

615
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,950
pink and purple.

616
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,460
Purple anyone there? Yeah yeah.

617
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:33,070
I think. Service check check the
Rubric because the last one said

618
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:36,250
like you have to make the
website look like good.

619
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:40,970
Yeah, like whatever that is
like, they never said what

620
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:44,696
kind of criteria they
actually wanted. So like a

621
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:47,594
salmon color, black
background with pink and

622
00:37:47,594 --> 00:37:48,422
purple text.

623
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:54,054
Not violent on the eyes at all.
Do you want like it flashing and

624
00:37:54,054 --> 00:37:57,420
pulsating? Oh yeah, like good
I've got the strobe light going.

625
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,644
Kind of thing, yeah?

626
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,950
Chasing the side margins of
the website. It just like

627
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,937
flashing flashing colors like
RGB, just really really basic

628
00:38:08,937 --> 00:38:09,823
colors though.

629
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,278
I'll see what I can do.

630
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:19,980
Search

631
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,750
I think we need to include some
photos and stuff as well.

632
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,776
Should we each submitted
photo of ourselves in the

633
00:38:28,776 --> 00:38:32,560
group profile? I was just
gonna use the ones that you

634
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,280
had on your individual pages.

635
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,785
With me, because mines
of my dog like this.

636
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:41,070
Funny photo.

637
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,026
So I'll I'll give you 1.

638
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:51,036
Or just in the original project?
It didn't have to be specifies

639
00:38:51,036 --> 00:38:55,194
anything about the actual web
pages that you create one. It's

640
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:59,352
it said somewhere we need to
include a range of like.

641
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,996
Like some graph, some data,
some photos, some.

642
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,464
Oh yeah, we need like
formatted data, images,

643
00:39:08,464 --> 00:39:11,460
videos, links and and
similar information. So

644
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:16,168
yeah, I just thought maybe
that that would go well with

645
00:39:16,168 --> 00:39:19,592
the introduction saying that
we've already got photos,

646
00:39:19,592 --> 00:39:23,016
set up, websites pretty
much. Just our report.

647
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,728
Can smoking graphs?

648
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,090
What do you say, Adam?

649
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:29,970
Rex

650
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,116
I've got that from a note
from last meeting.

651
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:36,370
Sick.

652
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:43,252
Uh, did the something about the
ideal jobs that needed to be

653
00:39:43,252 --> 00:39:48,012
they wreck highly recommended
putting it in a graph for

654
00:39:48,012 --> 00:39:51,820
comparison, which kind of seems
confusing to me.

655
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:53,940
Like was it?

656
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,276
That's a lot. Makes a lot more
sense in a graph. Yeah, I'm. I'm

657
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:07,444
guessing once we look at like
the burning glass site and see

658
00:40:07,444 --> 00:40:10,084
what what they're kind of
talking about. Like maybe we

659
00:40:10,084 --> 00:40:11,404
might have a better idea.

660
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,538
Little bit the the.

661
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,042
Oh yeah, two sections for ideal

662
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:21,850
job. Yeah it was. It was the
comparing each others jobs

663
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:25,269
to each other, one that they
wanted her I need. I need to

664
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:28,162
read that section is I still
have no idea what burning

665
00:40:28,162 --> 00:40:29,477
glass is a reference to.

666
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:35,587
I think it's just like
industry data for different

667
00:40:35,587 --> 00:40:39,394
occupations. So like maybe
how in demand specialist is

668
00:40:39,394 --> 00:40:44,470
or something. If you checked
it out yet. If you go onto.

669
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,416
Miss teams and then go to.

670
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,210
Where did you post your thing
Shannon about your job?

671
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:57,560
Data.

672
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,140
So.

673
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,724
Go to industry data and go to
the files section and Shannons

674
00:41:04,724 --> 00:41:05,984
posted one there if that.

675
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:07,260
OK.

676
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,893
Is that I looked at his earlier
and I was like that doesn't

677
00:41:10,893 --> 00:41:13,305
sound like what I was writing
and then I realized it was

678
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:16,640
something different. And
then it has all the Bangla

679
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,840
started there in the PDS as
well. It's just simplistic.

680
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,430
Call girls yeah, no worries.

681
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,740
Some dealer Google some of it to
understand what the hell they're

682
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,205
talking about. So once we've
once we've done the other ideal

683
00:41:32,205 --> 00:41:35,355
job section, the more personal
personalized wine, not the data

684
00:41:35,355 --> 00:41:38,820
one. The one where we just
compare. How are jobs are

685
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,600
similar or different? Once we've
kind of written a bit on that,

686
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,178
Adam? We might be able to
work on how to put that in

687
00:41:47,178 --> 00:41:48,294
their chart or something.

688
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,910
Wrapped up something or other.

689
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:57,310
If it makes sense or not
the question.

690
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,267
We could just just be the jobs.

691
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:07,449
Similar and then we each write
what similar. Then we what's

692
00:42:07,449 --> 00:42:10,410
different. We tried. What's
different just for the sake

693
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:14,029
it? I think they just want a
different form of visual

694
00:42:14,029 --> 00:42:15,016
display. Yeah, yeah.

695
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,326
Girl names, skills
and jobs and ticks.

696
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:25,920
Yeah, I was thinking of have you
ever seen those charts, but you

697
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,820
know when you have like you know
like 3 three like 3 circles and

698
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:34,670
then whatever the circles like
they get together it means like

699
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:38,520
those people they have like a
things in common typing skills.

700
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:45,000
Yes, maybe something like that
where you know everybody chooses

701
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,350
the industry and whatever your

702
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:51,218
industry has. Some you know.

703
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:55,170
Lions. How quick?

704
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,828
Excel PowerPoint, yeah.

705
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,335
Sorry, it's just looking
at your children.

706
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,035
Everything is not everything,
that's everything that was on

707
00:43:17,035 --> 00:43:19,200
the list here. Hello.

708
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,990
Freaking wrap it up then.

709
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,926
Alright, I'll stop the
recording here.
