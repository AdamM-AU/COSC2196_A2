work that missed it.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,320

18
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,174
So Is everybody happy
with the percentage that

19
00:01:10,174 --> 00:01:12,960
16 is at 16 1/2 or 16.6?

20
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,876
It just works out
as an even split.

21
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,872
2 Oh yeah, yeah everybody. Happy

24
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,540
Of course it was many.

25
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,065
Where do I find that
meetings files

26
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:42,840
contributions form dot dot
X?

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,860
And then I never I was gonna put
a folder in there to say actions

28
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,556
and agendas like I did on
GitHub, but I was like there

29
00:01:54,556 --> 00:01:56,096
someone else can do it.

30
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,368
And the group reflection George
and the group? Yeah yeah. So we

31
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:12,676
need to. Team the team
one the group

32
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:15,262
reflection. One that
with the team.

33
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,513
Oh yeah, I've got. It
contributes to that. I

34
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,301
haven't done that yet.

35
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,393
When so everybody just gonna
write something or we gonna like

36
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:28,708
get all together in elaborate.

37
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,138
In the first meeting we did.

38
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,454
Just need to do it again for
this, then somebody can just

39
00:02:39,454 --> 00:02:40,690
squish them together.

40
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,710
I had done that look like
the web page done.

41
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,830
Cool.

42
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,148
And then the last one will be
like if there's any like

43
00:02:57,148 --> 00:03:01,372
changes to the repo that will
be doing. Anybody will be

44
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:05,212
doing any changes. Everybody
is going to keep. Make sure

45
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:09,436
what's on the Ms teams file is
matches what's on GitHub.

46
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,684
Except for the different
spellings or grammar that

47
00:03:13,684 --> 00:03:16,748
changes that we make in the
next day.

48
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,174
Yeah, that's like
they can be well.

49
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,012
The individual documents can
have the spelling mistakes

50
00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:28,253
as long as the site in the
report doesn't.

51
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:35,546
And all of this one has to be
done before Sunday, right?

52
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:39,876
Because that's the when we
when we plan to submit,

53
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:41,175
ideally before lunchtime.

54
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,830
'cause we want to submit around

55
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,470
lunchtime. To both the PDF and.

56
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,380
The Ms teams document and then
we can all do our contribution

57
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,660
form submission after that.

58
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,930
So I I'm actually working
tomorrow morning. Yeah, so can

59
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,914
we push it back?

60
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,800
Three hours.

61
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,892
Or there, is there a reason
web submiting at midday? I

62
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:10,612
was just easier for me to do
it on midday.

63
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,678
Yeah I can.

64
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,868
Do a 10.

65
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,970
10:00 PM.

66
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:20,700
Yeah.

67
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:27,666
And then at 10:00 PM, Daniel
needs to lock the GitHub repo to

68
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:33,019
read only. OK OK OK yeah, no
worries so that Yeah 'cause If

69
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:36,409
we make changes to it afterwards
submitted we lose marks.

70
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,818
Yeah, OK, so once we've done
this admission and we don't

71
00:04:40,818 --> 00:04:43,860
really want changes once matys
copied everything from the

72
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,240
website and the documents to the
report, because then they

73
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,268
probably get missed or not make

74
00:04:49,268 --> 00:04:54,678
it in. Yeah yeah, so that one.
And plus once of Repose locked

75
00:04:54,678 --> 00:04:58,058
then we won't lose marks if
anyone changes something later

76
00:04:58,058 --> 00:05:00,762
and it stops anybody
accidentally deleting them, the

77
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:03,478
revo. As well, when it's
read only.

78
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,560
Then at 10:00 o'clock every
Monday or whenever they get

79
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,485
a chance like the following
day after we've submitted,

80
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:17,060
you've all got to go to
GitHub to Daniel's repo and

81
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,360
click the fork button.

82
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,690
OK, yeah, that's part of the
criteria for the assignment.

83
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,228
We've all got to have a copy
of it.

84
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,488
GitHub profiles yeah, yeah.

85
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,959
Yeah, I'll I'll have my my group

86
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,323
reflection. Finish by
tonight, so that should be

87
00:05:38,323 --> 00:05:40,199
ready before 10 probably.

88
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,858
Come on, don't don't fork it
before we've all submitted our

89
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:47,946
stuff because you won't get the

90
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:52,082
changes. So if you **** it now
and we do some updates tonight

91
00:05:52,082 --> 00:05:55,214
or tomorrow, they won't be in
your copy of the repo, just

92
00:05:55,214 --> 00:05:56,258
just pointing that out.

93
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,449
OK, cool Ann.

94
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,500
I'll remember my question in
a second. Sorry yeah. Well

95
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,600
yeah that's all everything
that I have to do. Agenda.

96
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,290
Yeah I don't know what else
we another subject.

97
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,178
You could ask the group
reflection questions.

98
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,280
Maddie.

99
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,150
Yeah, 'cause we've got our
response I got yeah Daniels

100
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,686
response. Forgot Georges
response. Don't know we don't

101
00:06:31,686 --> 00:06:35,490
have Daniels response 'cause you
went there in the in the morning

102
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,660
so we need medis and Daniels
responses to those questions.

103
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,791
That's the one that comes
together is a 400 word piece,

104
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:47,639
isn't it? Yeah, but everyone
wrote like kinda 600 words or

105
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,649
so for their individual words
so we can grow it.

106
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,938
Pretty short as well.

107
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,583
I don't see how the how it
could possibly answer those

108
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,513
questions. One sentence each
and then it amounts to 400.

109
00:07:07,513 --> 00:07:10,736
Anything we can do is maybe
trying to find like common

110
00:07:10,736 --> 00:07:11,029
themes.

111
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,690
If I said similar things, just
say a popular point.

112
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,998
Wow, I don't know.

113
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,396
We'll just do it. Do it. We've
done in. He can just read it.

114
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,210
So you want me to read it then?

115
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:31,650
Yeah.

116
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,170
So just some quick
product placement.

117
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,390
My Christmas

118
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,060
not fun.

119
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,710
We get paid a dollar every
time we do that.

120
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,900
That's mine.

121
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,258
Or ask questions.

122
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,138
Yeah, yeah so.

123
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,036
What went well? What you think?
What went well in the team?

124
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,759
Think just getting.

125
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,400
Starting early.

126
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,980
Starting Eli was pretty.

127
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,998
Pretty Ki think we would have
been screwed if we haven't

128
00:08:23,998 --> 00:08:25,600
started early. Yeah.

129
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,089
Nice and early and we started on
time. Not really. Yeah, we don't

130
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,158
want to. We don't want him to
think we started before the day

131
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:37,410
that we were supposed.

132
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,874
We had a group organized a bit
early, but we didn't actually

133
00:08:42,874 --> 00:08:45,502
start early. They told us to
start organizing groups.

134
00:08:45,502 --> 00:08:48,714
Pretty much the first week.
Yeah, that we should look at

135
00:08:48,714 --> 00:08:50,466
doing it and which we did.

136
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,364
So we formed groups on time
which was just before everyone

137
00:08:55,364 --> 00:08:59,538
else. Yeah, except but I
think Brad already had his

138
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:03,402
done by the time we all
joined up about it, but he's

139
00:09:03,402 --> 00:09:05,012
done before the week started.

140
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,028
Yeah, and I think the
regular meetings were good.

141
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:15,466
I mean when we first
started, we didn't really

142
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:19,286
think that they were all
necessary, but I think we've

143
00:09:19,286 --> 00:09:23,488
done well with them. I think
we've used them quite well.

144
00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:26,162
Yeah, so maybe there's
something in that.

145
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,065
Then what could what
could be improved?

146
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,630
Nothing is perfect.

147
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,890
You can improve on awesome.

148
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,980
Teams

149
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,938
listen miss teams.

150
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,130
Sort out like file storage
system, sort of between GitHub

151
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,322
and Ms teams so we don't have to

152
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:50,518
double up. Or I don't know.

153
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,392
OK, there wasn't. There is a
plugin that you can use that

154
00:09:57,392 --> 00:10:00,038
will sync Ms teams to get.

155
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,929
Aubrey fly fly.

156
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,050
It's involved to set it up
because you need to. You need

157
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,230
somebody. You need the person
that owned the repo to set it

158
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,410
up, and then they've also got
to be the ones that created

159
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,470
the Ms teams group.

160
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,922
Yeah, I think I think we did
well with Ms teams as best we

161
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:28,352
could. And like Shannon Adam
did well with creating the

162
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:31,896
different channels, channels
and files and then uploading.

163
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,164
The different groups in it? Yeah
Yeah, but then you uploaded all

164
00:10:37,164 --> 00:10:41,155
of this stuff as well. You know
anything that was on the repo

165
00:10:41,155 --> 00:10:44,839
you put on teams and that was
really handy. I don't think.

166
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,398
I don't think we could have
improved their like that was

167
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,720
really good. It's just Ms
teams was a bit.

168
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,191
It was getting painful when
the image is still like copy,

169
00:10:55,191 --> 00:10:57,540
paste, copy, paste, copy,
paste, copy, paste, drop and

170
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,845
drag all over the place.

171
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,352
Someone's editing that one.
I've gotta wait, then forget

172
00:11:02,352 --> 00:11:05,186
about it. 3 days I don't want
Oh yeah, that's gonna go there.

173
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,245
The use of Ms teams
is just it's painful.

174
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,810
We used it well considering.

175
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,270
Yeah, I think it's like canvas.

176
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,660
The more you get, the more
you use it. The more you

177
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,100
get used to it. Like yeah.

178
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,720
Yeah.

179
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,150
Just because you used to
return, you know you use a

180
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,650
turd. Doesn't mean you
should get used to a turd.

181
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,350
I'm putting that nicely. I
would have used another 4

182
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,020
letter word that Tim would
like to sing in the

183
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,387
transcript.

184
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,310
In at least one thing
that was surprising.

185
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,860
No arguments, everything was
pretty chill between

186
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,640
everyone's good. I was
surprised it went so well.

187
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,034
I like, I always go into group
projects thinking, Oh, it's

188
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:13,048
going to get done at last
minute. Who's going to lag

189
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:16,336
behind where we gonna have to
pick up after we didn't really

190
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,980
have to do any of that.

191
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,394
Yeah, unless the whole bunch
are crumbs on the GitHub so

192
00:12:22,394 --> 00:12:23,738
you guys can clean that up.

193
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,109
Yeah, it's good.

194
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,090
I went.

195
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,758
Yeah, and it on time, so
that's good.

196
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,654
On time with the right
amount of meetings.

197
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,670
Yeah, good insect
squishing those in.

198
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,290
Anne. At least one thing that
you have learned about groups.

199
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,764
So as hard as I thought it
was going to be.

200
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,180
Working with strangers was good.

201
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,220
Yeah.

202
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:14,950
Yeah.

203
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,856
I know I put on mine that you
know, it was like it was

204
00:13:19,856 --> 00:13:22,424
surprising how well we got along
with each other like we already

205
00:13:22,424 --> 00:13:23,494
knew each other for years.

206
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,997
Yeah, I think we've done
well there.

207
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,720
I've learned that it's not
always hard. It's not always

208
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,281
hard work to work in a group.

209
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:35,330
Yeah.

210
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,150
Sorry guys.

211
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:45,028
That's all at the beginning. I
was like, oh, this is gonna go.

212
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,576
And then, just like you know.
But it went really well. Just

213
00:13:49,576 --> 00:13:52,206
like bang yeah, divvying up
the work went really well.

214
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,573
Yeah, I thought that was
going to be tricky.

215
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,969
Yep, good Dan.

216
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,868
Oh yeah, that's it.

217
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:04,870
Sweet.

218
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:15,512
Yeah, so we've just gotta all
we've got to do is right up the.

219
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:22,078
Group affection, reflection.
Upload that and then the PDF

220
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:23,554
and that's it.

221
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:26,879
Yeah, pretty much.

222
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:33,106
The PDFs are two Part 2 document
thing. Did you? Did you see that

223
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,442
in the assessment criteria?

224
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,430
First one.

225
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,350
Hold on, I've got a page here so
we need one with the assignment

226
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,130
in the report on the cover page
it had we have to change the

227
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,020
template so it's got a link to

228
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,458
the. Website. And the
GitHub repository.

229
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:58,577
And then the the full normal
report. Anyway, as you're doing,

230
00:14:58,577 --> 00:15:03,998
and then the second document is
A is called the PDF Ms teams

231
00:15:03,998 --> 00:15:08,585
info which needs all the Ms
teams artifacts such as agenda,

232
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:12,338
notes, recordings, minutes,
action notes and the Ms teams

233
00:15:12,338 --> 00:15:16,520
invite link. Which is like a
one pack which which you can

234
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,303
just copy off the website
'cause I got all the document

235
00:15:19,303 --> 00:15:20,568
links on there. Yeah yeah.

236
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,066
Like a 10 page thing? No, no.
It's just like you grab all the

237
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:28,912
agenda notes. And the action

238
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:32,850
report action. Action documents,
so you grab those.

239
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,996
Combine them and just like and
condense them into like a

240
00:15:35,996 --> 00:15:38,356
couple of pages. I copy,
paste, copy, paste, put the

241
00:15:38,356 --> 00:15:38,592
dates.

242
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,750
Yeah, well I.

243
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,145
Hey Jakes and then just put a
title on it. This was this

244
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:51,805
document. I don't know that
last one. If you if you want

245
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:55,160
sorry and you know what, I
realized that we didn't do.

246
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,075
Nobody wrote minutes.

247
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,376
Did we have to or was that
just the transcript? It says

248
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:03,567
here that he wanted minutes
and action.

249
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,990
Did we did the action?

250
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,620
Minutes and action nights,
though. Kind of the same thing.

251
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:16,552
Yeah, it's fine. That would be
great if we could do that.

252
00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:19,018
George, yeah, yeah I'll do the.

253
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,748
PDF Microsoft Teams, yeah?

254
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,502
For all the links, it yeah I
can do that tonight.

255
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,722
All the links she walks with
the meetings go away and

256
00:16:32,722 --> 00:16:36,264
then you click links and
then you just grab the three

257
00:16:36,264 --> 00:16:37,874
team links off each meeting.

258
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,048
OK, and then the Ms teams invite
link is on the main page with

259
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:47,512
the little Ms teams icon I made.

260
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,966
Yeah, I guess I'm doing
that tonight.

261
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,935
I'll finish my group reflection
up to this and then I can start

262
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,710
working on that and then.

263
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,060
Maybe just upload them to teams
when you're done them.

264
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,706
So we can then Adams submitting
all of it.

265
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,724
So after then then you pull
it from there and then

266
00:17:15,724 --> 00:17:16,980
submit it into canvas.

267
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,707
Ah, the PDF. Yeah, yeah,
I'll send me both of them

268
00:17:23,707 --> 00:17:27,877
to canvas. Yeah, but you
pull it from from team.

269
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:29,870
Yeah.

270
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,894
And then we've got to like the
a couple of five days after we

271
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:39,206
submit the assignment, or five.
I think it's like the 25th or

272
00:17:39,206 --> 00:17:41,690
something. You've gotta submit
the A2 contribution form. If

273
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,278
you don't do it, you won't get
a mark for the assignment. So

274
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:49,142
is that is that the one we just
talked about, or is that the

275
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:52,730
one we just? That's the one we
just don't sign? You've got a

276
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,490
separate assessment called. I
think it's just called like a

277
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,318
two or something.

278
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,408
Yeah, you gotta submit it to
their or you won't get graded.

279
00:18:01,408 --> 00:18:04,477
If that does not have the app
involved or their little

280
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:05,314
program or something.

281
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,190
Spot plus.

282
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,130
Spike plus we've got like 2
weeks after the due date to

283
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,980
complete, but he hasn't finished
putting everybody in it yet.

284
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,250
Because not everyone was in
a group or kept changing

285
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,018
groups or something.

286
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:26,660
So we don't have links to it
yet, right? Yeah.

287
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:32,164
OK, so. That will talk about
that next week then.

288
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,958
Those two things we'll talk
about next week.

289
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,220
Which do you think?

290
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,569
State contribution form.

291
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,970
Contribution forms you should
really just submit on Monday so

292
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,885
you don't forget or even.

293
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,950
Little. Could probably submit
him now. I don't see why not

294
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,778
since we've got it filled out
and then tomorrow. I'm gonna

295
00:18:58,778 --> 00:19:02,954
submit the other bit. I don't
think he's going to have a

296
00:19:02,954 --> 00:19:07,130
problem with that, so do we each
do each submit the contribution

297
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,306
thing separately, or is it just
the one person everybody has to

298
00:19:11,306 --> 00:19:14,090
submit the contribution form
individually? Only one person

299
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:17,918
submits the PDF assignment at
right? So yeah, so I'll submit

300
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:21,398
the PDF assignment report and
the Ms teams info PDF.

301
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,660
But that's for the project, but
you and I'll also submit myself

302
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,675
the contribution form, but every
team member has to submit the

303
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:36,050
contribution form. Clear Yep, so
if 'cause Yeah.

304
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,310
As one person forgets that
person won't get a grade

305
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,610
for the assignment at all.

306
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,090
Yeah.

307
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:49,694
Open that shooter thing is
that an Ms teams at the moment

308
00:19:49,694 --> 00:19:54,758
the contribution form yeah? Or
is it on canvas? It's on teams

309
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:56,446
at the moment, yeah?

310
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,177
So that's all done so I can

311
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:00,880
download it right now. Submited?

312
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,846
Yeah, I'm to get out of order.
I'll make it a PDF 'cause he

313
00:20:04,846 --> 00:20:08,670
wants it in a PDF so I'll save
it as a PDF and then I'll re

314
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,104
upload it and give you the.

315
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,800
Great front, you stand ready.

316
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,977
Oh, thank you what? What did I
Press? I don't know.

317
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:19,870
Squidbillies

318
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,690
Sorry, is that just? That's just
what I've just signed that we're

319
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,170
talking about. Yeah, right?

320
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:30,720
So since then.

321
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:37,510
It's uploading two teams now, so
you should see contributions

322
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,398
form dash completed PDF.

323
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,590
So we each we each submit
that one.

324
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,178
Do the assignment A2
contribution by the 25th of

325
00:20:57,178 --> 00:20:59,922
October and you can do that now.

326
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,698
Try to download it.

327
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,750
Even though it says this
assignment doesn't count

328
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,730
towards your final grade.
But if you don't submit

329
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,830
it, you don't get it.

330
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,220
According to Mr. Tim.

331
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,560
It's good.

332
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,790
I have

333
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,130
everyone else good burger.

334
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,245
We're missing Sam Sam
Tonight. We could remind him

335
00:21:56,245 --> 00:21:57,705
to submit that floor.

336
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:05,870
Comments.

337
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,710
Done.

338
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,450
Dude.

339
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:19,671
Maddie, can you put some
pictures of $100 bills at the

340
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,755
end of that report?

341
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,922
And then put it put some text
over it. You can't touch this.

342
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,932
Was there anything else we
needed to talk about?

343
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,088
I think that's it.

344
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,020
Everything is pretty much
ready to go.

345
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,750
Dress where everyones at.

346
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,168
My brain's no longer
working, sorry.

347
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,520
Times like 4 hours ago.

348
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,104
What contribution forms that's

349
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:08,144
already submitted? So I don't
know if that just borderlines

350
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:10,405
everybody in one person
submitted. It is

351
00:23:10,405 --> 00:23:11,374
automatically submits it.

352
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,550
What anyone else? Yeah,
'cause I just went into my

353
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:20,070
assignments and just went to
submit it and it says it's

354
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,350
already submitted at 723.

355
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:28,096
Oh really, oh I I 23 so you got
I had my window open while Adam

356
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:32,248
you are submitting yours so I
had already opened the window so

357
00:23:32,248 --> 00:23:36,400
maybe that's why might allow me
to submit it. I thought I

358
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,438
submitted mine too.

359
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,020
Just there just says resubmit.

360
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,667
Does it matter 'cause he
said we each had to submit

361
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:49,708
that individually, yeah.

362
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:56,796
'cause mine says if you click on
the details it says my name and

363
00:23:56,796 --> 00:24:01,584
then submitted it, but I didn't
actually submit it. Hold on. I

364
00:24:01,584 --> 00:24:04,776
see submission demos, download
contributions, form dash. Ah

365
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:09,564
hold on hold on. I submitted it
so that's in the list.

366
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,869
And many submission.

367
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,530
I'm guessing.

368
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,546
We got a submission details. It
has the name of who she met with

369
00:24:21,546 --> 00:24:23,041
him, 'cause he said, Yeah.

370
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,430
He said that we all had to
submit that.

371
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,690
It's all right now.

372
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:34,795
Would be interesting to see when
you do submit the actual aid to

373
00:24:34,795 --> 00:24:39,070
the rest of it, whether it all
comes up on all of ours as well,

374
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,350
whether they've already just
automatically grouped us. Yeah,

375
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,770
'cause we join that group. Maybe
it worked out that that's the

376
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,480
The Group 1. Maybe they tap

377
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,809
flagged it. But it says.

378
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,950
It says when you go to
assignments in a two

379
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:56,459
contribution, you go down the
bottom of those dot points. It

380
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:59,649
says if your group cannot agree
on the contribution factors,

381
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:03,695
fractions. You have to submit by
the deadline as a single PDF.

382
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:08,670
Consolidated contribution forms,
which insinuates that we could

383
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:12,275
each submit something different
and separately, yeah.

384
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:17,310
Otherwise, I should we all just
retry and resubmit where each of

385
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,510
us are asking for.

386
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,200
I think we should just contact
talk to Anthony.

387
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,240
Because.

388
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,177
It's like two or three of ours
have gone through, but not the

389
00:25:31,177 --> 00:25:34,018
rest. I mean, you really
don't need 1, right?

390
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,394
You do that, so maybe action to
say once Adam submits the rest

391
00:25:40,394 --> 00:25:44,788
of it tomorrow. If you click on
when we click on assessment to

392
00:25:44,788 --> 00:25:48,844
to see if everyone else says
it's submitted, and then it says

393
00:25:48,844 --> 00:25:53,576
resubmit. That way you know that
just linked or six of us and all

394
00:25:53,576 --> 00:25:54,928
our submissions are mutual.

395
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,850
So when Shannon, when you open
the A2 contribution assignment

396
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,580
on the right hand side, does it

397
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,486
say? Submited exclamation point,
the data submission details and

398
00:26:07,486 --> 00:26:10,895
then downloaded. Sorry download
contribution form completed.

399
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,660
It looks like you're connected.

400
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,550
Then when I click on submission
details, it comes up saying that

401
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,810
I submit it, but I didn't.

402
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,288
It must be all joined together,
yeah, just cool. How many days

403
00:26:25,288 --> 00:26:28,678
do so we have to submit that
particular thing, Adam.

404
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,596
There's another way to 25th,
25th, so we can ask them before

405
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:37,008
the week is done.

406
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,280
Yeah.

407
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,334
We've got, we've got until next
Sunday to ask to clarify, so

408
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:44,582
that should be fine.

409
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,768
Yeah yeah Oh yeah.

410
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,960
Mine to show up like
that too. Yes it is.

411
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,120
I just realized my Mike was on
mute. Submitted, yeah?

412
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,587
Show anything you just
shown out, yeah.

413
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,606
It was a little strange
that you weren't talking.

414
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:10,517
Self and other stuff like
submission details details yeah.

415
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,304
Alright. So. Very good, well on
track or my son.

416
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,938
Does the project or
do you have a name?

417
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,958
Oh yeah, like an app name.

418
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,930
772

419
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:33,130
**** Sorry I I. I thought
about, you know, maybe we

420
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:36,835
should give it a name and it
was just like security to you.

421
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:44,512
Matthew, Facebook just call
it the social resolute

422
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,564
Revolution. Social Security.

423
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,124
What's on my site. Social
Security number.

424
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,472
I acted like oh people might
install it by accident. Pay a

425
00:27:56,472 --> 00:27:57,816
dollar for in America.

426
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,070
American to be downloading it.

427
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,551
I was thinking why is like the
app could make money with her

428
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,875
like out out breaking like the
rules like 'cause we don't want

429
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:12,476
to keep any of the cast in any
of the users data. Otherwise

430
00:28:12,476 --> 00:28:15,523
it's just as bad as user
Facebook. Yeah, so it's like.

431
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:21,440
We could sell ads, but will tell
him all. All we can tell you is

432
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,820
our target audience is people
that are concerned about their

433
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,214
online security. So you know we
could put like VPN ads in the

434
00:28:29,214 --> 00:28:30,566
bottom or like automatic

435
00:28:30,566 --> 00:28:35,350
scheduled. A security check will
you have to pay for the

436
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:39,978
privilege to have that feature?
So you gotta pay like a you know

437
00:28:39,978 --> 00:28:44,533
$5. Boy, you know just the basic
version for dollar, I was

438
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:47,763
thinking about that because
there's not. There's not many ad

439
00:28:47,763 --> 00:28:50,024
ads that will want to sell to

440
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:52,250
someone who. Good audience.

441
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,098
Everyone likes Doritos.

442
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,460
Are you on social media at
the moment? Did you think

443
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,420
about eating a bag of Doritos
while you run a security

444
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,660
check up on your social media
platforms? Because these

445
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,100
chips are just delicious.

446
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,981
I'm holistic to cheese. I
can't eat. Doritos are and you

447
00:29:17,981 --> 00:29:21,182
can't have the normal pack.
You have to have the party

448
00:29:21,182 --> 00:29:24,092
size pack because that's big
enough for a single city.

449
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,704
I recently just got over at
Doritos addiction.

450
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:35,576
I get these temporary addictions
that I'm like I can't stop.

451
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,049
Three dice was the most
recent one.

452
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,645
When you get to absolutely
monster bags on Audi. Yeah, I

453
00:29:43,645 --> 00:29:47,665
haven't had him for a second.
This is those giant. The mega

454
00:29:47,665 --> 00:29:49,005
bags that are like.

455
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,756
There's like two party
size bags.

456
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,890
It's Inside, is it still half
full of air probably?

457
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,944
Alright, so we'll finish
recording here then, Yep.

458
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,290
Come up with the name.

459
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,756
One last thing before the name
that's alright. I asked Adam, I

460
00:30:14,756 --> 00:30:18,435
just wanted to see your guys
opinion on it. I don't want to

461
00:30:18,435 --> 00:30:21,548
give him too much more work
before. Oh those changes. Yeah,

462
00:30:21,548 --> 00:30:24,661
you should bring that out. Just
the changes on the website.

463
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,438
I don't know like all pink.

464
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,988
Like I'm just thinking because
there's a lot of text fields in

465
00:30:34,988 --> 00:30:38,225
the rest of my broken up into
tabs with her, but break like

466
00:30:38,225 --> 00:30:41,711
the IT work. The video can be
home tab, then have a tab beside

467
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:46,927
it for the transcript. It just
means when and then the same for

468
00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:50,554
all technologies. Have a home
tab and then selections.

469
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,850
And project on the break that up
into individual things in tabs

470
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,410
as well, not just

471
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,062
it, just means like if Tim, for
example, is on the home page and

472
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:04,735
goes, I'll go look at the
project idea first. It doesn't

473
00:31:04,735 --> 00:31:06,193
just do that big massive scroll.

474
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,064
It is just clicking up and
then if you do it really

475
00:31:11,064 --> 00:31:14,606
quickly, it just gets stuck
in this and just goes to.

476
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,126
And eventually stops
and like Jack pot.

477
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,980
You're not like that idea,
especially with the

478
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,220
transcript. I reckon 'cause
That's probably quite long.

479
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,617
Now you can see the video
there, you click on the

480
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:32,487
transcript and then you'll have
the heading straight after the

481
00:31:32,487 --> 00:31:35,931
video of YT technologies. If he
clicks back and the same of

482
00:31:35,931 --> 00:31:39,088
technologies, you can click
back to home and then you just

483
00:31:39,088 --> 00:31:40,810
gotta Scroll down a little bit.

484
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,110
Technologies.

485
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:48,967
Sir, is that much extra or
is that alright?

486
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,149
You've already got actually
technology and tips.

487
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,726
I mean just having around tab

488
00:31:56,726 --> 00:32:00,742
home tab. What are we gonna put
on the home tab? That's all. I

489
00:32:00,742 --> 00:32:03,334
don't know 'cause that's why I
deleted it 'cause I was like.

490
00:32:03,334 --> 00:32:04,630
There's nothing to go on it.

491
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,102
I don't know, you can just put
the floor. If I shrink the

492
00:32:09,102 --> 00:32:12,042
project down, they'll be less
scrolling. And then if I.

493
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,588
Stripped down mighty work I
think will save a bulk of that

494
00:32:16,588 --> 00:32:18,133
stay there longer than like.

495
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:23,080
Yellow ones, the other one.
That's fine. Yeah, at least with

496
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,820
project, because I thought that
somebody might say this. I did

497
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,220
already break it up into
individual parts 'cause I'm like

498
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,640
I'm not editing this again and I
know somebody's gonna ask for it

499
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,660
to be exact.

500
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:41,235
But I didn't think about the the
IT work one when I was doing it,

501
00:32:41,235 --> 00:32:44,914
I was thinking about it and I'm
just like maybe they won't know

502
00:32:44,914 --> 00:32:47,178
I can get out of not doing it.

503
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:53,566
Sorry, I was laughing at what
Daniel said. Oh sorry, I didn't

504
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:55,864
hear what no comment he made.

505
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:01,294
Just replying to Adam from
like an hour ago. Oh he said

506
00:33:01,294 --> 00:33:04,664
Oh yeah, looks looks something
along the lines. It looks

507
00:33:04,664 --> 00:33:08,034
good. Maddie will catch all
the rest of the mistakes.

508
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:13,006
That way I won't try and do
any proofreading.

509
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,470
Woodbury

510
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,284
alright, so I'll stop breaking
that stuff up now even though I

511
00:33:20,284 --> 00:33:21,669
was hoping it was done.

512
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:26,611
Me, I might have to update
my group reflection now to

513
00:33:26,611 --> 00:33:28,166
say that you're all mean.

514
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,609
Romaine and I maybe do stuff
late at night.

515
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,138
Yeah, 'cause you're gonna
go to bed early.

516
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,690
I was I was just going to
play Red Dead Redemption.

517
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,172
I'll just play it while I'm
doing it, and then just slowly

518
00:33:49,172 --> 00:33:51,882
slide by wine while I'm waiting
for the voting screens.

519
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,626
When it cuts to that
cinematic cinematic views of

520
00:33:56,626 --> 00:34:00,166
thing, yeah, yeah, yeah. So
the name of the app.

521
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,230
Mongoose magic.

522
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,450
Face one Facebook.

523
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,422
What you said, what rhymes with

524
00:34:13,422 --> 00:34:16,157
duck? No, no, no
face and then but.

525
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,780
Gotta keep it classy. Yeah, it's
certainly a project code name we

526
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:27,084
can. Put down that we will
do marketing research to

527
00:34:27,084 --> 00:34:30,108
come up with a better name
in the future.

528
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:35,120
Now as well. What's up with the

529
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,608
name next song? We could
just click and sucks.

530
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,240
Should.

531
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,660
Facebook security.

532
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,428
When you're on public
transport and really need to

533
00:34:51,428 --> 00:34:52,688
protect your face and butt.

534
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,270
Facebook safely.

535
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,186
I know it sounds like you gotta
put your face in a butt.

536
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,400
Safely.

537
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,404
I think they call that a
dust mask.

538
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,525
Oh wait, wait wait, here's
one we prepared earlier.

539
00:35:20,525 --> 00:35:21,750
This can be the logo.

540
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,340
I'm here. What's a good time?

541
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,680
Secure social.

542
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,080
Secure if you wanna be
real boring.

543
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,780
That's a good description of
what it is, I guess.

544
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:48,720
Yeah. All your data belong to
us, but that might be simple.

545
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,760
I think that's racist.

546
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,770
'cause it was a video game
that they got translated and

547
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:55,930
they did it wrong.

548
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,134
I don't know what's this
username generator.

549
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,700
Pro James.

550
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,900
Lighting.

551
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,270
It can't have the word face.

552
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:33,889
Secure SM like a radio station
listen tune in to secure.

553
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,648
Kind of catch you.

554
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,280
Perhaps a little
misleading though.

555
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,638
I don't know how this one is
going to generate a name is

556
00:36:49,638 --> 00:36:52,830
asking me like option one? It
gives you a list seller like

557
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,224
select Dinosaur, option 2 bugs
and then unusual animals.

558
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:02,062
I don't even know how to say
that that didn't work. Well,

559
00:37:02,062 --> 00:37:04,648
sounds great, and romeris
beady tags.

560
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,240
Do you have favorite dinosaurs?

561
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,700
Ever done is love?

562
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,529
The T. Rex.

563
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,450
'cause it's the cow. Is
it gonna eat the goat?

564
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,718
I had a.

565
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:29,586
Louis and I had a manager, very
temporary manager, but the first

566
00:37:29,586 --> 00:37:33,366
thing he asked me was what is
your favorite Dinosaur?

567
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,610
I don't even ******* know.

568
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,380
The ice breaker.

569
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,050
Yeah.

570
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,882
I did find an answer for him

571
00:37:43,882 --> 00:37:47,170
though. And then he had an
answer I didn't recognize.

572
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,826
It was just like a little
running thing.

573
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,068
Factor of some country.

574
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,648
Is there one way? Is there a
generator where you can put in a

575
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:05,090
bunch of trigger words in it
all, like push them together?

576
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:11,007
Yeah, that is why it's called
businessnamegenerator.com.

577
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,428
How do you find?

578
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,290
Hot.

579
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,610
Social media security.

580
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,706
Hey, you know there's a chat
thing that we could use in

581
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:28,270
the meeting too?

582
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,090
To put the name.

583
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,607
I am there that you could use.

584
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:40,850
I don't know what you're talking
about, so if you click the hand.

585
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,100
Where it says raise your hand.

586
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,360
And then there's that little
conversation button. Click on

587
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,560
that like the The Little Bubble
Square thing with the.

588
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,410
Just say it.

589
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,910
Next to the left of that.

590
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,000
Yeah.

591
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,116
It tries up on Ms teams.

592
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,459
Just got the notification
on my phone.

593
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,290
Alright.

594
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,350
It only has to be a code name.

595
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,800
For the project, like a
project name and then the

596
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,230
app name can come later.

597
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,180
Yeah.

598
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:33,990
Well, you mean?

599
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,980
Socially secure, secure social.

600
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,385
There is a VPN to protect
my *** online.

601
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,490
Protect my *** online.

602
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,718
What's this app? Do you know it

603
00:39:54,718 --> 00:39:58,610
protects my ship? Private
*** on Facebook.

604
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,392
Private Facebook. Yeah,
though I wouldn't call it

605
00:40:02,392 --> 00:40:03,576
private *** on Facebook.

606
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,708
Revealed on Facebook.

607
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,753
Just I'm on. I'm taking this
medication that makes me really

608
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:25,416
tired right now, so I'm going to
be getting no help.

609
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,440
Spelling out gibberish.

610
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,538
Seamonkey Social Security.

611
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,898
Yeah, can you?

612
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,382
Yeah, you need to say it's a

615
00:40:48,516 --> 00:40:50,630
didn't call it Grand Theft
Auto online.
