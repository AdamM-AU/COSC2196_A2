1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,060
So first group meeting on

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,419
the. 26 of
September.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,346
And I will meet my friend.

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,750
Sorry.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,122
He was it was on earlier today,
but I just haven't seen him

6
00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:29,119
since about. 12 one o'clock.

7
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,858
I thought we.

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,620
Started too early so we haven't
heard back from Adam.

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,503
Will probably be here any minute
I guess yeah.

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,858
Happy to wait.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,740
Yeah. So what do you guys
think of assignment one? How did

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,790
you go with assignment? 1M? How
you feeling post?

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,900
I think it was OK.

14
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,337
Like it was a bit more work than
I expected for.

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,070
I don't know if I did too
much or not, but.

16
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,756
Or too little I I'm not really

17
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:10,201
sure 'cause. Is there's like a
lot of elements that you had to

18
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:15,566
put together. And I think my
website was pretty gross.

19
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:22,320
Black one black one. Yeah
yeah yeah that one.

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,140
Purple, pink or purple or
something like that. Yeah, like

21
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,524
when I originally did the links
like they were like a really

22
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:32,472
dark blue and I couldn't see
them so I made in pink and it

23
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:35,574
looked really good with the
Black. Yeah, I like that. That's

24
00:01:35,574 --> 00:01:39,522
what I remember about it. I saw
it in the like the rubric it

25
00:01:39,522 --> 00:01:41,214
discussed how it needs to look

26
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:45,790
good. But I don't really know
what they expect. The good

27
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,830
looking website to be. Yeah, I
like. I like my 2002 vibe for my

28
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,630
website, so it's pretty good.

29
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,880
Couple of your websites looked
really good, so I mean they were

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,495
pretty good, but I'm I think a
few of them. Like with the

31
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:04,270
Scroll down and like the.

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,740
The section changed as you
Scroll down. That was really

33
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,440
good. I think that might've been
you George or someone.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,102
No, I think that was a Adam. Or
maybe Adam. Yeah, yeah. I think

35
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:18,618
Shannon had the best like title
page that was super slow. Yeah

36
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:22,134
yeah, that's a template. Or use
that said, you could use a

37
00:02:22,134 --> 00:02:25,943
template. So I decided to go
with it. Yeah, why not? It looks

38
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:30,045
pretty good. I mean it did take
a little bit of editing in it,

39
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:32,096
but not as much as I thought.

40
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,220
Find any templates I like trying
to collect all of the resources

41
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,470
for GitHub and like all of the
HTML stuff and.

42
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,770
All new to me, but I didn't
realize there were things like

43
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,865
that to go off of this so much
information that I found after

44
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:53,015
submitting the assignment that
would help me, and there's still

45
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:56,480
more than I'm discovering now.
I'm like, oh, that would have

46
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,740
helped. That would help.

47
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,120
Yes, I would have liked to have
made menus or like multiple

48
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,770
windows that would be nice. Most
multiple tabs I mean.

49
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,661
Yeah, I spent a lot of time on
W3 schools looking at random

50
00:03:11,661 --> 00:03:14,043
stuff. That's pretty much how I

51
00:03:14,043 --> 00:03:16,754
yeah, no. Website actually
actually don't think it's that

52
00:03:16,754 --> 00:03:20,834
bad, but was it W 3 schools or
the other one that was like one

53
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,826
I found really easy and one that
I found really hard.

54
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,558
I just love you guys. Can't hear
things like here Mega website.

55
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:31,890
Yeah you like.

56
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,584
Rules are light. It was the
other one that was like a

57
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:38,961
tutorial on what you did a
walkthrough tutorial, so I can't

58
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:43,861
get it. That on some of those
GitHub tutorials I had were a

59
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:48,997
bit a bit full on yeah and then
and then Tim just did it like in

60
00:03:48,997 --> 00:03:50,602
two seconds on the lecture.

61
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,634
Yeah yeah, and I found a written
format of that. Those directions

62
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:58,757
and really simple form after
they submitted the assignment.

63
00:03:58,757 --> 00:04:03,615
So cool I'll say that later, but
I'm is. I did let the whole

64
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:07,432
thing. They followed the video
where it used their terminal to

65
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:11,495
use GitHub. But I'm just scared
of using it and accidentally

66
00:04:11,495 --> 00:04:15,032
like destroying everything. But
in the right run command like,

67
00:04:15,032 --> 00:04:17,992
I'm pretty sure like it it
wouldn't, but you know.

68
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:23,090
Just like one command and you've
just like destroyed everyone

69
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,514
else is work kind of thing,

70
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:31,648
Yeah? I I did all of mine within
GitHub on my browser. I didn't

71
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:36,160
use anything else. I didn't use
a text file or anything, 'cause

72
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,048
I just didn't know how. Yeah I,
I ended up doing that halfway

73
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:45,184
through 'cause it's just easy
like when I was like adding

74
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:49,696
photos and stuff. I just dragged
it in instead of pushing into

75
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:54,768
the repository. So I'm I'm still
learning all of the commands.

76
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,959
Off the website.

77
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:05,496
Where can I might like when when
last we do this again for

78
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:10,798
assignment two? I might like
right down my own commands like

79
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:13,208
guide sheet or formula died

80
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:17,290
once. Yeah, what about you
George? How do you go?

81
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,571
Yeah, mine was pretty simple
like just like plain white an

82
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,748
yeah I was reading a lot of.

83
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,110
W3 that that website and I'll
just basically just like

84
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,466
following every step. And yeah I
read a lot.

85
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,981
But yeah, I think like I have a
copy of my.

86
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,194
Of my website, so I think I can
you know, as we progress, I

87
00:05:43,194 --> 00:05:45,955
think I can just keep keep
changing things and then just

88
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:47,210
keep making it like look.

89
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,530
Better. It's just the start, so

90
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:56,916
yeah. Yeah, we heard
from Adam yet.

91
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,378
Not yet. I thought there were
six of us and then I thought

92
00:06:01,378 --> 00:06:04,834
there were five of us, and then
there's definitely 6 and I

93
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:06,850
thought I was going a bit nuts.

94
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,378
I think I think originally there
was six, I don't, I'm not sure.

95
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:17,046
Yeah. They're they're still six.
I mean, it was like an hour ago.

96
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:18,218
I was like 5.

97
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:25,250
What what's the limit on team
members is like 6 or 6?

98
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:25,650
OK.

99
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,670
Pretty good, that's right. Try
recommended in four to six.

100
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,978
Oh, maybe Phil Haack
in sometimes?

101
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:44,826
Yeah.
Bad or something when you want.

102
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:48,386
When you start a meeting mine I
didn't get anything.

103
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,933
Nominator. Charlie going. I
think we have to put it on the

104
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:58,376
on the calendar maybe and then
you get like a reminder,

105
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,819
something I didn't add it in
through. I didn't add actual

106
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:04,636
attendees, I just automatically
assumed that goes for everyone

107
00:07:04,636 --> 00:07:07,766
in the group, but my reminder
came through Microsoft Outlook

108
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:13,485
itself. I had outlook open,
so there the reminder came

109
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:15,060
up through outlook.

110
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,856
No, I really want three screens.

111
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:27,200
It's great. I'm
not sure. I've just opened Ms

112
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,480
teams on my laptop.

113
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:36,050
Yeah. But
it didn't.

114
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,430
That's alright.

115
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:45,386
Anyone have any good name ideas?
Yes, just thinking that like no.

116
00:07:45,386 --> 00:07:49,982
I was thinking about that the
other day. Yeah 'cause it says

117
00:07:49,982 --> 00:07:54,594
in the. Assignment like shape
that like employers could look

118
00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:55,818
it up later.

119
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,959
So yeah, we don't do so. Be
mindful of you silly.

120
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,890
Damn nonhuman

121
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:12,672
sign. It's something cool,
something that sounds like smart

122
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:15,550
and technical. Yeah,

123
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:22,860
yeah, nothing. Did they
give you some sort of format for

124
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,340
the teams? Like

125
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,918
We sort of sport wise or I I
have no idea like even examples

126
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:33,207
of teams they said it could be

127
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:37,356
anything. But my friend started.
It is like Oh Nighty Company and

128
00:08:37,356 --> 00:08:41,854
it was called Ret SIM which is
just Mr backwards. But it looks

129
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,584
like a really fancy technology

130
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:50,859
name. Yes.
Try putting aladji on the end of

131
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:53,710
another word. Yeah.

132
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,230
This is not my Department.

133
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:05,870
Maybe we can think
on that as we

134
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,850
go, yeah? Sure.

135
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:16,000
Our agenda first was team
profile name and.

136
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,310
So it's kind of roles in the
group, but we can.

137
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,088
I was thinking maybe we could

138
00:09:24,088 --> 00:09:28,609
start with. 'cause I seem to
want us to.

139
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:36,102
Discuss assignment one abit and
how that impacts us as a group

140
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:37,800
is bizarre but.

141
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,560
We've got to do that.

142
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,418
Sign in. The
assignment 2.

143
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,590
What page in my arm?

144
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,090
Page.

145
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,168
Page 2 actually.

146
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,770
No.

147
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,662
No, you're

148
00:10:06,662 --> 00:10:10,830
right. Um yeah, so
profile.

149
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,704
Page 4
profile down

150
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:23,268
to specifications. Um, that
aim profile so will need a team

151
00:10:23,268 --> 00:10:26,544
name, but we can think on that.
That doesn't need to come first.

152
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:27,804
It we're having trouble there.

153
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:34,010
Um, so will each need to wash
our own little paragraph of

154
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,624
personal information. Which I
think we can do separately and

155
00:10:37,624 --> 00:10:39,314
then just bring that down.

156
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,882
That's fairly straightforward.
Yeah, and then we need to

157
00:10:43,882 --> 00:10:48,810
discuss the the test that we've
the personality test. I think

158
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:56,144
they mean. Um, I'm just
what that means for us.

159
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,378
Spell and you will have a chance
to reflect on how well you got

160
00:11:00,378 --> 00:11:03,700
this work later, so giving you
feedback on assignment one as

161
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,626
well, and I'm not sure if like
we're supposed to talk about the

162
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:08,834
results from our first

163
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:14,876
assignment as well. They will
wait for the hour, yeah?

164
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,988
I think we need to touch on it
by def. It's definitely

165
00:11:19,988 --> 00:11:22,860
mentioned that we should talk
about it, yeah?

166
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,092
But the other country that just

167
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:31,173
yet. But we can talk about the
three personality tests for the

168
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:37,680
team profile. Just to, I'm not
sure how they want us to write

169
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,980
that out, but it says to
condense the relevant content

170
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,700
you produced from assignment

171
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:49,620
one. I I completely misread, so
I can't condense one anymore.

172
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,824
It's pretty much basic as it

173
00:11:52,824 --> 00:11:57,330
was. Only write 11 big paragraph
about the all three tests.

174
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,633
'cause I honestly think
these tests were. I don't

175
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:01,524
know. They just.

176
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,622
Yeah, they're slightly accurate,

177
00:12:04,622 --> 00:12:07,880
but. I found

178
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:14,675
something, yeah? After it
very accurate too as well.

179
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,596
I found one pretty accurate,
150% accurate and one was like

180
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:20,376
completely the opposite of me.

181
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,178
I think I think two of mine
actually got contradicted each

182
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,684
other a little bit. Yeah, I got

183
00:12:27,684 --> 00:12:31,936
that. Yeah, but like I don't
know if it's just like you know

184
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:36,135
when you see like a tarot card
reader and they say Oh yeah,

185
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:39,688
this and this and like put
connections in your head that

186
00:12:39,688 --> 00:12:42,918
you might not really be
connected with. Yeah yeah, that

187
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:44,533
explains me perfectly when it

188
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:48,822
doesn't really. And then it
becomes a bit of a self

189
00:12:48,822 --> 00:12:51,902
fulfilling prophecy. Or it's
just so broad that it can

190
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:57,462
attribute to anyone. New things
will be happening to you

191
00:12:57,462 --> 00:13:01,690
tomorrow. Probably like you, you
may end up with financial

192
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,740
troubles in the coming months.

193
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,773
You know, or you have to pay
bills or something? I could have

194
00:13:08,773 --> 00:13:09,796
told you that.

195
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,320
Now I will.

196
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,524
Yeah, I'm sorry, maybe we just
need to. It says to summarize or

197
00:13:16,524 --> 00:13:18,612
condense. So I think maybe it's

198
00:13:18,612 --> 00:13:22,338
like. So who was
introverted? I was.

199
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,970
Yeah, I got like 79%.

200
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,579
Wake up 99.

201
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,102
Not sure. I think online were

202
00:13:34,102 --> 00:13:39,756
pretty like. Similar like I was
like a bit of everything, but I

203
00:13:39,756 --> 00:13:41,386
got like the turbulent mediator.

204
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:48,630
From the 16 personalities one,
yeah I got mediator as well,

205
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,159
yeah? Well I got.

206
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,690
The learning styles 1.

207
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,440
Like it was a bit of bit of

208
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,570
everything as well. For the
learning styles I had.

209
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,060
Visual learner and partly

210
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:15,930
kinesthetic. So it was like
even Stevens, but slightly

211
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,460
slightly more visual.

212
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:25,508
Wish my brain was
working a little faster

213
00:14:25,508 --> 00:14:30,212
today. People do for the third
test like the one you could

214
00:14:30,212 --> 00:14:34,436
choose like. I just did another
personality one. Yes I do it,

215
00:14:34,436 --> 00:14:37,250
yeah. Yeah, same.

216
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,848
As I look through the other ones
and I just didn't really, I felt

217
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:42,390
the output of the actual thing

218
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:47,610
wasn't. I like told you whether
you're one of two different

219
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,650
things you know, like, yeah.

220
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:54,996
Aspera, see how lucky you are to
fully conspiracy theory one.

221
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,820
I don't know if you wanna tell
your employee that kind of.

222
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,078
Employer that kind of

223
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:06,260
information. Think only added
one year. It's just what I run.

224
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,660
What kind of celebrity
personality do you represent?

225
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,335
Like it, it gives you the other
percentages. But then what?

226
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:19,435
Celebrities? Nice life and mine
came out as Dexter and I thought

227
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:20,710
that wasn't right.

228
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,812
Good thing this isn't online
course I guess. I just thought I

229
00:15:23,812 --> 00:15:26,884
just, you know, take that away,
not put that one on there.

230
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,620
Around this.
My computer is slightly frozen.

231
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,890
Camera like very

232
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:45,208
dark. Yeah I can. I can
just see a silhouette every Adam

233
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:49,788
pretty dark. You look like a
hacker offi ads, yeah?

234
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,123
Yeah, I got the computer screen
glowing on you, so it looks even

235
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:59,460
more ominous. If I can fix
it, but it keeps giving me

236
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,540
an error when I get a load
up the camera settings.

237
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,356
So I just want you doing that
and I'll just summarize what

238
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:12,035
we've touched on so far, so we
haven't come up with a group

239
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:13,167
name yet, because that's.

240
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,428
A lot of creativity, so I'm just
thinking about that in the

241
00:16:18,428 --> 00:16:19,844
background as we talk.

242
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,276
Um, and then we kind of talked
about assessment one, how many,

243
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:28,392
how we went. Obviously we don't
have any feedback yet. We don't

244
00:16:28,392 --> 00:16:33,194
have our mark, so we can't talk
about that. But they do want us

245
00:16:33,194 --> 00:16:34,566
to at some point.

246
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:41,478
And then we need to summarize
out personality tests and woman

247
00:16:41,478 --> 00:16:46,112
into. Like a great personality
or summary of the personalities

248
00:16:46,112 --> 00:16:50,270
within the group. So we're just
going over our personality test

249
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:54,666
results. Just briefly, and I
think we'll have to.

250
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,954
OK Alright. Personality summary,
like obviously some of us have

251
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:05,896
summarized it quite a lot, but
if we could just put 4 hours, 16

252
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:09,779
personalities the Myers Briggs
test, we could just put the the

253
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,662
name rather than the description
and then for the next one.

254
00:17:13,662 --> 00:17:15,074
Whether we are a.

255
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,836
Visual learner, kinesthetic

256
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:23,975
learner or. So like 7 rise again
in like 160 words to the for the

257
00:17:23,975 --> 00:17:30,964
page. Yeah I yeah.
Or even I think

258
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:33,640
because the. It works.

259
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,540
Say.

260
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:44,883
Yep. As a only a small
mark that it gets anyway, yeah,

261
00:17:44,883 --> 00:17:50,252
it doesn't make too much if it
like. The Rubric says that it's

262
00:17:50,252 --> 00:17:53,556
just all relevant information
and keeping it simple.

263
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:57,756
I have to get, expects us to
write like a big essay on group

264
00:17:57,756 --> 00:18:01,942
dynamics and that kind of stuff.
So like I'm thinking if I was to

265
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:04,035
write mine, I'd write that I am

266
00:18:04,035 --> 00:18:08,548
a. What is
my?

267
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:15,266
Oh, it's an ISFP dash T, which
means the adventurer and just a

268
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:20,882
sentence on what that means. And
then I would put that on a

269
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:24,338
mostly visual learner but partly
tactile kinesthetic learner

270
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:26,498
probably don't need to write.

271
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,721
And then a like a very
short summary of might be

272
00:18:29,721 --> 00:18:32,631
quiet personality test. So
we could each do that and

273
00:18:32,631 --> 00:18:36,123
just leave that there if we
want it. What do you think?

274
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:43,536
Sounds like. So are we
also said earlier Adam that we

275
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:45,406
need to do a tiny?

276
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:50,730
I'm just looking at the
assignment team profile on page

277
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,778
4. Have you got that off in

278
00:18:53,778 --> 00:18:58,960
front of you? I
go in a minute.

279
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:24,032
Yeah,
I

280
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:28,434
got
it

281
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,635
open

282
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:34,160
now. Page 4

283
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,848
Um, down at specifications.

284
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,746
So we haven't come up with a
name yet, but will will do that.

285
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:45,527
That's straight forward and then
personal information. We can.

286
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:48,617
Each writer and paragraph and
then bring that together and

287
00:19:48,617 --> 00:19:52,325
just put on the page and then
for the team profile each

288
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:56,033
summarize our three tests and
then put that in there as well.

289
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,860
Sorry, do you think we could
each do that individually?

290
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,084
Interest rate altogether.

291
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,870
Yeah yeah, yeah.

292
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:11,190
So. We want
to ideal jobs.

293
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:16,340
We

294
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:43,522
Yes. Time to organize this one,
so it might be good to have some

295
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:48,827
regular times. At least one
scheduled time each week.

296
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,235
Scheduled half an hour or

297
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:54,468
something at least. I've been
looking through the assignment

298
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:57,246
details and what team said in

299
00:20:57,246 --> 00:21:03,035
the. The. Meeting this
week. It seems like we have to

300
00:21:03,035 --> 00:21:06,740
do too, but it would be good to
have at least one plan.

301
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:12,430
Sorry, can we all available
tomorrow to do this week

302
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,874
second meeting? Or does
anyone not available

303
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,350
tomorrow afternoon evening?

304
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,496
I can after 630

305
00:21:22,496 --> 00:21:26,250
again. Or not, yeah,

306
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,970
I'm fine. Or or or tomorrow
morning, but I know I think one

307
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,790
of you is from Perth. That might

308
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:40,295
be a bit. Yeah, I could
probably set an alarm, I don't

309
00:21:40,295 --> 00:21:47,272
mind. If it's 6:00 AM, maybe but
yeah, so same time tomorrow for

310
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,850
our second meeting.

311
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,920
Cancel. Just want
to chair tomorrow.

312
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,520
Discuss

313
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,775
tomorrow.
Sorry, I guess

314
00:22:03,775 --> 00:22:08,130
we'll. Yeah we can. How long
have we been recording for?

315
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,716
2728 minutes OK

316
00:22:12,716 --> 00:22:19,034
sorry. Oh
So I got a little bit longer to

317
00:22:19,034 --> 00:22:24,342
just come out. One or two more
things. And yeah, yeah, through

318
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:28,830
the rest of the spec sheet in
the second meeting tomorrow.

319
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:33,726
Yeah, yeah. So I think we could
talk about ideal jobs 'cause

320
00:22:33,726 --> 00:22:37,806
that kind of needs to be
discussed bouncing off each

321
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:42,860
other. Compare and contrast the
ideal job speech person in the

322
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,500
group. This may have changed
feedback from assignment one we

323
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,592
don't have feedback.

324
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,640
What common elements are there,
if any, so?

325
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,246
I'll start with

326
00:22:56,246 --> 00:22:58,450
my. Good job.

327
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,590
So I cherish.

328
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:09,500
Search

329
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,160
I see support officer in South
Melbourne and remote working

330
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,606
required initially due to cover
19 so I kind of wanted a job

331
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:23,394
that would be remote most of the
time but there weren't a lot of

332
00:23:23,394 --> 00:23:25,788
jobs going like that. I like the

333
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:32,155
sound up. Um, but I think
I'd also like to work.

334
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,892
Advice at times as well. So this
is with saying Australia S A&E,

335
00:23:36,892 --> 00:23:40,168
which is a national mental
Health Organization working to

336
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:44,172
make a real difference in the
lives of people affected with

337
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,084
complex mental health issues
through support research and

338
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:51,452
advocacy. So I would be the
right person for the staff who

339
00:23:51,452 --> 00:23:54,364
work insane Australia. That's
basically the job, yeah?

340
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,290
And.

341
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,718
Appeals to me because I have an
interest in mental health and

342
00:24:02,718 --> 00:24:05,508
community service. I've had an
interest in mental health and

343
00:24:05,508 --> 00:24:08,298
community services before I
studied it for awhile. It taken

344
00:24:08,298 --> 00:24:11,925
down that it wasn't the kind of
work I ultimately wanted to do.

345
00:24:11,925 --> 00:24:14,994
However, I wouldn't much like to
work behind the scenes and

346
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:17,505
provide Technical Support for a
great organization that provides

347
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:19,740
mental health services. Um?

348
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,800
There's a lot of skills and
experience that's required for

349
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,432
the job that I don't have.

350
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:31,110
Just get and I really don't
understand too much about. So I

351
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:35,840
when the same on page 4. And
yes, I meant like.

352
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,920
What changes may be made like
other than learning the

353
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,825
skills I don't know. I think
that's what we're supposed to

354
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:46,310
discuss. Did anyone get a
different impression?

355
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,530
Thank you. No.

356
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:57,916
Sorry. I mean, like
you sort of chose that that

357
00:24:57,916 --> 00:25:02,272
position, 'cause it was a bit
broad as well.

358
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,152
Yeah, so that's that's similar
to what I went through like.

359
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,440
You're like a. Systems
integration officer, which sort

360
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,466
of works for like software and
hardware and everything. So I

361
00:25:13,466 --> 00:25:17,858
just picked the one of the
broadest sort of jobs I could

362
00:25:17,858 --> 00:25:19,688
find, 'cause I'm not really.

363
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,318
Sure, what path would wanna take

364
00:25:23,318 --> 00:25:29,337
yet? It is like is like
an integration officer for

365
00:25:29,337 --> 00:25:34,241
disability. People with like
impairments like vision and

366
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:39,550
deafness. And with like hardware
or software to help people

367
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,110
integrate with different

368
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:44,763
technologies. The sound of that.
I wouldn't say that one.

369
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:49,294
That's cool, so does does a bit
of everything, like with like a

370
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:52,426
lot of web development kind of
stuff as well.

371
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:58,012
So if I wanted to go to that Ave
or if I wanted to work with

372
00:25:58,012 --> 00:26:01,082
actual hardware systems, it also
pretty much does everything that

373
00:26:01,082 --> 00:26:08,166
job so. So I think the goal
of this part of the assignment

374
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,746
is to just summarize or.

375
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:18,915
Summarize that that is the jobs
with picked desire. Our ideal

376
00:26:18,915 --> 00:26:20,820
jobs are indeed.

377
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,460
They compared the jobs.

378
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,140
Each person in the group.

379
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:32,328
I'm a bit can I? I'm not 100%
sure like how was supposed to

380
00:26:32,328 --> 00:26:34,096
collaborate with this part.

381
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,810
Elements are there, if any.
That's one of the first

382
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,778
questions. Yeah, sorry. Common
element you've identified is

383
00:26:40,778 --> 00:26:45,230
it's broad and both yours and
mine are bored. So what about?

384
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,495
What job did you get? I chose a
back end developer.

385
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,532
Basically, we write the back end
software. So how to explain it?

386
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:59,684
Probably easy take Facebook. Are
they got a front end team that

387
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:04,528
does all the UI and the design?
But then they'll have a back end

388
00:27:04,528 --> 00:27:06,604
team that makes all the magic

389
00:27:06,604 --> 00:27:13,158
happen. Basically, code that you
don't see, so like.

390
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,417
Content distribution the fact
that your videos get resized

391
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:22,147
and compressed all happens
with back end software, not in

392
00:27:22,147 --> 00:27:23,566
the interface that's.

393
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,383
My sleep watch. How is that?
Because I don't really like

394
00:27:28,383 --> 00:27:31,713
doing the graphical creative
side of things. My skill sets

395
00:27:31,713 --> 00:27:33,711
more suited towards that at the

396
00:27:33,711 --> 00:27:38,188
moment, so. So perhaps this
difference that would be that

397
00:27:38,188 --> 00:27:42,214
yours is quite nitty gritty and
detailed, and ours is probably

398
00:27:42,214 --> 00:27:46,606
the ones that Sam and I have
chosen. Probably more broad. I

399
00:27:46,606 --> 00:27:49,900
think that's the question was
supposed to be answering.

400
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:56,244
Yep. Stardust, like this,
based on the little knowledge, I

401
00:27:56,244 --> 00:28:02,130
have an. Your website, it seems
like that matches up with your

402
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,390
skills. Daniel, where are you?

403
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:11,158
Yeah I did I did not put very
much thought into this, but I

404
00:28:11,158 --> 00:28:15,046
just found a systems
administrator add which I think

405
00:28:15,046 --> 00:28:17,206
is pretty broad, like Salmon

406
00:28:17,206 --> 00:28:20,620
Madeleine. It's yeah.

407
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,900
Just like overseeing and
computer network for like a City

408
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,040
Council, I thought that would

409
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,785
be. After a lot of different

410
00:28:30,785 --> 00:28:34,340
bases in. Be kind

411
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:41,290
of interesting. But do you know
what some of the specifics of

412
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,595
it? Specific

413
00:28:43,595 --> 00:28:45,720
say. Not.

414
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,808
Sense of technical skills and
experience in Windows Server.

415
00:28:51,808 --> 00:28:55,504
Active Directory Exchange. SQL
Server, VM Ware virtualization

416
00:28:55,504 --> 00:29:01,048
and San Technologies. I don't
know what most of that means so.

417
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,933
Does anyone know what that
means? Mostly adding, adding,

418
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:08,686
and maintaining users in Active
Directory, adding new machines

419
00:29:08,686 --> 00:29:13,273
so they domain are there the
audio visual parts? Probably a

420
00:29:13,273 --> 00:29:14,941
conferencing system that they're

421
00:29:14,941 --> 00:29:17,094
using. But you've gotta look

422
00:29:17,094 --> 00:29:22,463
after. Yeah, so you get given
pretty much a big stack of

423
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:24,115
paperwork when your movie.

424
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,774
Alright, So what was the name of
the the title of the job systems

425
00:29:29,774 --> 00:29:33,588
administrator? I think I think
that's one you definitely need,

426
00:29:33,588 --> 00:29:36,808
like a few years experience as
well, like a network

427
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,740
administrator is at 1.1 sort of

428
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,896
more junior job. Do you have a
junior network administrator?

429
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,730
Or systems administrator
and then a senior.

430
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,140
Sweet and makes it easy.

431
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,863
How is the place where they had

432
00:29:50,863 --> 00:29:55,774
Chinese in Naturals? Yeah, so
yeah, that would be definitely a

433
00:29:55,774 --> 00:29:57,889
good way to do it.

434
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,810
Not just learn from the pros,
not too much pressure.

435
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,650
So I'm not sure that I know too
much about that one, so I can't

436
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,018
really draw similarities or

437
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:12,428
differences. There
can anyone else?

438
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:17,438
I choose the.

439
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,389
IT support specialist pretty
much, I think, the same as you

440
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:26,998
marry. You know, like
a kind of like abroad.

441
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:34,254
Broad. Korea 'cause I
don't know much about the job

442
00:30:34,254 --> 00:30:37,998
either. But yeah, my plan is
just to basically.

443
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:44,430
Help businesses you know? Just
provide the IT support an

444
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,678
reportes in maintaining the

445
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,600
networks. Oh cool.

446
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,270
Stop. Yeah so.

447
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,514
Submitted crossover. Even with
Daniels job there as well.

448
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,485
Yeah, every choice, yeah so

449
00:30:59,485 --> 00:31:04,290
yeah. So I guess what I think it
might change. I think it might

450
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:08,210
change in the in the future as
we know more, but for now I

451
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,330
think it's just that.

452
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:14,850
So I guess Adam is already got a
bit bit more of an idea of what

453
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:17,655
his one training and we're not
really sure, so we pick

454
00:31:17,655 --> 00:31:20,460
something general just to just
to start off with I guess.

455
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:24,320
Controls

456
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,947
Then Weird with the question. I
ask 'cause you have to actually

457
00:31:28,947 --> 00:31:32,548
for an advert for a job all can
actually falling advert for a

458
00:31:32,548 --> 00:31:36,426
job that I actually wanted. So I
just put one that I've found so

459
00:31:36,426 --> 00:31:39,750
I wanted to do something for one
I chose was cyber security

460
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,520
analyst. However I just wanted
something within the field of

461
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,628
cybersecurity. Now there's so

462
00:31:43,628 --> 00:31:46,309
many different specific.
Certifications in different

463
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:50,425
ways. You can do cyber security.
The one I'm looking at is

464
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:53,855
actually like the integral
hacker role where I can actually

465
00:31:53,855 --> 00:31:57,285
breach the defenses so they can
implement devices to protect

466
00:31:57,285 --> 00:31:58,314
their systems better.

467
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:05,386
Cool sounds definitely like the
most glamorous know then.

468
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,650
Out of all of ours.

469
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,778
Put on the wire.

470
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:15,929
Best drain it's movie like the
Hugh Jackman Swordfish we got

471
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:18,165
the cubes coming together.

472
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:22,110
So what's the French? It's each
position position from the

473
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:26,444
others. If anything, I think we
summarize that how similar or

474
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,990
different leukorrhea plans
across the group. I think we

475
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,172
covered that too.

476
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:37,510
Um? Be tackled
numerous ways in writing

477
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:41,390
and in visual elements of
concise coverage analysis,

478
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:44,785
slash, completing covering
all would be good.

479
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,230
Concise, so short and to the
point, which is good because I

480
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,190
think we can do that just fine.

481
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,616
Um strongly recommended table
presentation of comparison data

482
00:32:54,616 --> 00:32:59,404
as it is a very easy to
highlight as it is very easy to

483
00:32:59,404 --> 00:33:02,482
highlight a lot of information,
simple for others reading.

484
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:03,508
Interpret too so.

485
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:09,369
I'm thinking maybe we could eat
right out like.

486
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,550
What job title is?

487
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:17,144
Like the main roles and then
put, put it in a table each.

488
00:33:17,144 --> 00:33:22,156
Sorry, put the hour jobs in one
block of the table edge and then

489
00:33:22,156 --> 00:33:25,378
list the differences underneath
and contribute it like that.

490
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,810
Could be very quick.

491
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,540
Maybe? Right?

492
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:38,190
So. I'm
having trouble explaining what I

493
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,335
mean, but yeah.

494
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:45,168
And then we just find a little
aspect of somebody else. Is

495
00:33:45,168 --> 00:33:49,716
that similar and say this is
my ideal job blah blah, and

496
00:33:49,716 --> 00:33:54,264
Maddie's is also similar in
this way and then that kind of

497
00:33:54,264 --> 00:33:58,054
might be it? And then will
just fill those individual

498
00:33:58,054 --> 00:34:02,223
ones together and and also do
a pretty table as well,

499
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:06,392
putting it in a table is
probably the tricky part I

500
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:09,803
think by trying to make it
look yeah efficient.

501
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:15,290
Anyone got experience with
putting that on the website?

502
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:20,810
Making a table on website? My
website? I made a really tiny

503
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:26,186
table. Just to try it out, but
it's not not anything pretty

504
00:34:26,186 --> 00:34:29,946
like not for something as
comprehensive as this, but it

505
00:34:29,946 --> 00:34:32,202
depends how pretty you want it.

506
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,165
And how much time we wanna spend

507
00:34:34,165 --> 00:34:38,740
on it? It's a concise, so we
could keep that part simple.

508
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:42,300
Life like this like this
elsewhere. As long as we're

509
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,368
meeting that criteria.

510
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:49,656
So we've reached the 40 minute
mark. Do we wanna pick a chair

511
00:34:49,656 --> 00:34:50,982
for tomorrow and?

512
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:56,460
Leave it here for today. That
sounds like a plan.

513
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,128
Anyone want to volunteer?

514
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:03,370
I have one question that we
should probably look at

515
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:07,560
tomorrow. We gotta organize the
custom questions that we wanna

516
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,140
ask Steven. Are you OK 'cause he
just wants to just like?

517
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:15,508
So we just like each of us just
come with one different, like

518
00:35:15,508 --> 00:35:19,226
what would one question it just
like added up to like the other.

519
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,240
By your questions and yeah.

520
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,552
Questions beforehand there so so
we want to prove messages on

521
00:35:28,552 --> 00:35:33,256
teams. Do we want to come up
with a question each contribute

522
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:36,784
to list and will have that
sorted by tomorrow.

523
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,590
Yeah, we can do that. Yeah
tonight or something, yeah?

524
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,712
How does that sound item with?
Yeah, that should be great. He

525
00:35:44,712 --> 00:35:48,365
just wanted a heads up so 'cause
he doesn't want to be like

526
00:35:48,365 --> 00:35:52,299
caught off guard on a question
and be like I don't know how to

527
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:58,220
answer it. So just for the
record, what's what was his name

528
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:03,540
again? Steven, and he's a senior
software developer at Microsoft.

529
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:09,392
I think he's working in the Xbox
teams at the moment.

530
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,104
Cool man, so you've already
spoken to him.

531
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:17,010
Yep, it is just waiting for when
we're ready to.

532
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:21,146
Give him the questions and
then give him a couple of days

533
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:24,479
notice and then we can do the
interview. Lovely, he's happy

534
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:28,721
for it to be video recorded,
so if we want to put the video

535
00:36:28,721 --> 00:36:30,842
recording on the website we
possibly could.

536
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,676
Just apply that to the shooter.

537
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:41,821
Yeah, sweet. Phone and as many
of us who want to attend can

538
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:45,340
will probably limit how many
people ask questions though.

539
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:49,442
Yeah, each person ask a couple
of questions each.

540
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,915
Say I I think I read that
we all need to be present,

541
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:57,335
but we don't all need to be
asking questions is what I

542
00:36:57,335 --> 00:36:58,760
think that's what I read.

543
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,804
Because it's digital, like if it
was a interview in person. They

544
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:08,242
said like one or two people, but
digital and needs to be all of

545
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:12,363
us. The time zone difference
might be tricky for us all to be

546
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,265
there being there. He's in the

547
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:18,793
US. Put that on record, then if
we if we can't organize it to

548
00:37:18,793 --> 00:37:22,324
have us all there. Otherwise
we're going to do some Cardboard

549
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:26,176
cut out of each person. Just
having in front of their webcam.

550
00:37:26,176 --> 00:37:27,781
Remember what did they move?

551
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,100
What did he say, George?

552
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:32,378
Uh, what day is this? When
are you planning to do the

553
00:37:32,378 --> 00:37:32,607
interview?

554
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:38,361
Who will have to discuss it
tomorrow? 'cause we're going to

555
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:42,250
be there. Well, we can discuss
it through chat, 'cause I think

556
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,004
we're supposed to keep our
meetings through 40 minutes

557
00:37:45,004 --> 00:37:51,989
long. Yeah, so any other
quick questions before we go

558
00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:56,386
or. Do you wanna continue on
chat if we have any more

559
00:37:56,386 --> 00:38:00,820
questions? Yeah, I guess we
continue on chat. My batteries

560
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,040
are dead on my laptop so.

561
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,640
Finish quickly, I've added
little questions, document to

562
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,690
IT, work tab for the questions
for him so.

563
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:15,622
Of all these birds with these
questions on there, yeah yeah,

564
00:38:15,622 --> 00:38:18,678
how about just add extra
question on today?

565
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,940
For all that Word document

566
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:27,368
itself. Alright, I'll stop
the recording here then.
