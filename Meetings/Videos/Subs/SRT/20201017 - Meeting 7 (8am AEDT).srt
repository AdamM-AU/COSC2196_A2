1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,972
Just thinking about it, there we

2
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:12,310
are. Good morning everybody.
This is meeting #7 at 8:00 AM,

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,840
Australian eastern daylight

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,900
savings time. Today we're gonna
come with it. Contributions form

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,685
that we've all gotta sign and
cover some group reflection and

6
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:29,340
then any changes that need to be
made to the website or concerns

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,125
about the project, idea or any
other section of the site.

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,544
Believe everybody who has
completed the contributions for

9
00:00:37,544 --> 00:00:42,197
man is happy with the agreed
contribution so far that's been

10
00:00:42,197 --> 00:00:43,466
put on there.

11
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,650
Yeah. Yep, Yep.

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,150
OK.

13
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:58,164
So move along, then on that one.
I don't know if we're gonna get

14
00:00:58,164 --> 00:01:00,450
45 minutes out of this meeting.

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,959
Well, it says that we only have
have to do 20 and then.

16
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,300
Ah, OK, that's better. We might
be able to make the 20. Yeah, so

17
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,620
group of 20 group.

18
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,880
So group reflection we have
to answer 4 questions as a

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,300
group totaling about 400
words combined where we have

20
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,480
to cover what went well. What
could be improved? At least

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,420
one thing that was surprising
that we can all agree on as a

22
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,220
group at least one thing you
have learned about groups.

23
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,812
Yeah, and then we've got to do
like a 200 word version of that

24
00:01:41,812 --> 00:01:44,080
in our just for ourselves as

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,850
well. I think Daniel
and I already did the

26
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,900
individual ones, yeah?

27
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,138
I've got one from Daniel. I was
working on my last night, but

28
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:58,798
it's not finished yet and
everybody went over the 200

29
00:01:58,798 --> 00:02:03,190
words and now I like the
obligated to do like the similar

30
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,288
man as well.

31
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,248
Actually trimmed down a bit, I
was just like throw it out.

32
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,180
Whatever, that's alright.

33
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,698
I'll just answer mine the
same way I think it would be

34
00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:14,445
easier for everybody.

35
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:21,950
Right? Like moments like it was
here, 300 words or something

36
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,920
maybe. It's alright.

37
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,848
So I'm just gonna quickly put
yourself on the spot. He's can't

38
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,359
reference the content that
you've already written, so don't

39
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,033
look at it. What went well?

40
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,382
You got 10 seconds answers the

41
00:02:35,382 --> 00:02:39,828
question go. Finally, just go
quickly. I group came together

42
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:44,074
like how quickly were able to
organize meetings and set task

43
00:02:44,074 --> 00:02:45,232
for each other.

44
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,442
That was really good. We also
have friendly way really

45
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:53,788
quickly, yeah. And how easy

46
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:58,390
everything just. Yeah, how easy
it was to work with everybody as

47
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,260
well, like. We didn't have any
problems really. Everybody was

48
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,560
like happy to do.

49
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,660
The Tasks in.

50
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,636
Yeah, it was very smooth. I
think they made one mistake or

51
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:14,858
accidentally did something. Mary
thought she was gonna do.

52
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,820
Oh the translator.

53
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,300
The transcript. So that's quite
a bit because I was doing the

54
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,744
PDF, but then she wanted to do
the PDF and I'm like I just

55
00:03:26,744 --> 00:03:29,696
assumed I was doing the PDF
because I was doing the website

56
00:03:29,696 --> 00:03:32,648
and there was the conversation
we had about that we had to

57
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:36,092
submit the website and the PDF
and I was like I just copied and

58
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:39,290
paste it for my assessment one
and it got good marks so we'll

59
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,734
just do that. So I just assumed
that's what I was doing and it

60
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:44,456
says I can't know. I'd like to

61
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:49,038
do it. Yeah, everyone's over
eager to do to this year and was

62
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:53,042
like now I've got nothing to do.
I've gotta wait for people to

63
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:55,506
hand in stuff so I can do stuff.

64
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,776
Well, I found something to
do. I made tables, make some

65
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:03,808
nice make some nice graphics.
Yeah we we worked on the that

66
00:04:03,808 --> 00:04:07,504
all those tables and charts
and stuff and getting them to

67
00:04:07,504 --> 00:04:09,184
actually load on the page.

68
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,906
OK, so will do the
next question. What

69
00:04:13,906 --> 00:04:15,082
could be improved?

70
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,130
Well, I guess we answered that
to where we could.

71
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:26,390
Clearly outline some of the
tasks that we didn't had earlier

72
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:31,730
on. Yeah, just a few small minor
ones we missed, yeah?

73
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,110
And I thought.

74
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,454
Like we didn't really have a
problem, but when the Daylight

75
00:04:38,454 --> 00:04:42,128
Saving Time changed, like it
had to organize it better. Yeah

76
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:45,802
yeah we had like we went
through a pretty well 'cause

77
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:49,142
all you guys were pretty
flexible but it had real

78
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:51,146
potential to really cause some
issues.

79
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,853
I think I just assumed everybody
was in Victoria, like I saw on

80
00:04:56,853 --> 00:05:02,268
Shannons Page. He said he loved
him back as much as I can, but I

81
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:06,600
didn't read any further. But I'm
like Oh he's in Queensland and

82
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,932
what are and then I just assumed
everybody was in Victoria. You

83
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:13,098
know it should have known better

84
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:18,377
online course. Could be anyway,
like Georges Hamilton. Island

85
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:21,632
and Samuel are in your

86
00:05:21,632 --> 00:05:24,826
inventory. And I'm

87
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:26,840
liking. In Horsham.

88
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,082
So when I saw it, Dan wasn't
coming to the meeting this

89
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,812
morning like that makes sense

90
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:38,328
for gold. Four in the morning
for him he had to get up at

91
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:40,902
4:00. Yeah, 'cause he was
talking to him last night about

92
00:05:40,902 --> 00:05:44,178
the project and he was saying,
Oh yeah, I'm gonna be up at 4:00

93
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:47,454
in the morning so I'll be able
to review it then. Why why you

94
00:05:47,454 --> 00:05:50,949
going to fall? And he's like
a talking. Attend that

95
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:54,019
meeting. I might, you know
you don't have to attend

96
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:57,396
both. That's the reason we've
got the afternoon one so you

97
00:05:57,396 --> 00:06:00,466
could attend that one. It
goes. Oh, that makes sense.

98
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,185
WA doesn't have daylight savings

99
00:06:03,185 --> 00:06:07,412
doing. No, the header defriended
like 10 years ago to get rid of

100
00:06:07,412 --> 00:06:08,940
it. Yes.

101
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,500
Tonight. Owls don't have
it either.

102
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,798
Yeah, now we're good.

103
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,668
Yeah, yeah. Does New South
Wales still have it? I thought

104
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:25,172
they did. Or is it Queensland?
All I know is that Queensland

105
00:06:25,172 --> 00:06:28,384
got rid of it because of the
tourists that confused them.

106
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:34,478
Yeah, but like I'm what's Tweed
heads where the airport is like

107
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:39,087
half the airports in New South
Wales and half cent Queensland

108
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:42,020
and like yeah I'm on your phone

109
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,858
can change.

110
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:50,581
Suck.
But then you get to the terminal

111
00:06:50,581 --> 00:06:53,377
on the other side of the
airport. I'm early for my flight

112
00:06:53,377 --> 00:06:54,775
check, then they go back. I'm

113
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:56,811
late again. That would be

114
00:06:56,811 --> 00:07:01,087
annoying. It would really. That
would be horrible. That's crazy

115
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,917
daylight savings. I should get
rid of it. Farmers have

116
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:07,981
flashlights now and Tortures and
self driving vehicles.

117
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,465
And that usually out there
11:00 o'clock anyway. So

118
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:12,485
what does it matter?

119
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,853
So what was at least one
thing that was surprising to

120
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:22,250
everybody about? The group.

121
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,665
Like I was surprised like the
extra time and they help. We all

122
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:32,900
gave each other like you did the
GitHub tutorial and everything.

123
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,135
Yeah, so people like going
beyond what they needed to do.

124
00:07:37,135 --> 00:07:39,060
Even though we're pretty much

125
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,140
complete strangers. Yeah.

126
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,024
And good camaraderie in

127
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:46,658
teamwork. I'm surprised
how well it went.

128
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,530
Yeah. Because you got stuck in
Night, 5 strangers and just

129
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,812
given a task to do, you just

130
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:59,340
don't. You know everybody was
pretty period before everyone

131
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,170
joins in.

132
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:12,060
Yep.
It's good that was no

133
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,658
fights to fighting
over who's gonna do

134
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:18,742
what, it'll just,
it'll just clicked.

135
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:26,146
That's good. At least
one thing that you have

136
00:08:26,146 --> 00:08:27,580
learned about groups.

137
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,960
I just always keep saying that
there's no I in team.

138
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:45,210
Yeah. Yes, one thing
Open is where I work or where I

139
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,050
worked 'cause I've been

140
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,740
currently fired. The teams were.

141
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,578
Like the team aspect, it all
working at work doesn't really

142
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:57,418
work very well together. Yeah,

143
00:08:57,418 --> 00:08:59,938
because. It's just, um.

144
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,236
Yeah, a lot of bigger and a lot

145
00:09:02,236 --> 00:09:07,214
of **** I guess what I learned
from this group is that teams

146
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:11,342
actually can work together. Got
at work. I used to work by

147
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:15,126
myself only because when you put
two of these together, it's

148
00:09:15,126 --> 00:09:16,502
always just a clash.

149
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,117
'cause everyone had their own
like you so certain people you

150
00:09:21,117 --> 00:09:23,070
could work with. But then
there's other people you

151
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,071
couldn't work with. My God just

152
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:28,982
said. Yeah, completely
different personalities

153
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:30,734
throughout the group and.

154
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,668
So I can give The Apprentice the
job of digging a trench, then he

155
00:09:34,668 --> 00:09:37,034
will have a sugar beet digger
that range so they don't get it.

156
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,582
**** it, I'll dig the trench and
then you can do the hard stuff,

157
00:09:39,582 --> 00:09:41,948
but then he doesn't know how to
do the other stuff 'cause he

158
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,132
doesn't have the knowledge to do
it. Then you just like, well,

159
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:47,226
what do you want me to do it or
I'll do it all then and you can

160
00:09:47,226 --> 00:09:50,456
just. Sit down and
play on your phone.

161
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,080
I'd like a job playing on my
phone all day.

162
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,915
I guess you get what you got.
Amazing stuff in RT where you

163
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:03,455
gotta teach him how to do stuff
and then local always doing

164
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:06,405
boring stuff like fixing peoples
desktops or printer issues. I

165
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,945
don't want. Well once you learn
how to do those then you're

166
00:10:09,945 --> 00:10:13,485
going to be able to do the
complicated stuff, but you can

167
00:10:13,485 --> 00:10:16,730
watch me do the complicated
stuff and eventually you can do

168
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,840
it. Right? Then

169
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,470
Is it? Sure.

170
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:28,502
This sort of ties in with what I
wrote like good, good morale and

171
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:32,440
good camaraderie that goes along
way like when when people are

172
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,736
actively like they really want
to do the task with each other.

173
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,242
You know, it really helps a lot.

174
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,915
But we wanna get a good grade

175
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:47,094
and. Get through the assignment
to move on to the next one, so

176
00:10:47,094 --> 00:10:48,893
we had a common goal. It was

177
00:10:48,893 --> 00:10:54,196
pretty. Pretty good, and I think
we had a lot of fun too.

178
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,459
That was good.

179
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,506
Yeah, also as well, I think like
the seeing what other people do.

180
00:11:01,506 --> 00:11:05,610
Does you learn from that as
well? It gives you like new

181
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,056
ideas. Like you know there was
times where I was like oh ****

182
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,210
How do I do this? And then I
look at someone's work and I was

183
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,148
like, oh OK, I can do this as
well. It's kind of like.

184
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,450
Brings up more.

185
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,438
A wider view of what you
have to do.

186
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:30,905
I'm going to suddenly learn a
little bit about making a

187
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:36,965
website and stuff by trying to
figure out how to update data

188
00:11:36,965 --> 00:11:39,995
and stuff on the web page.

189
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:45,110
So Linda Linda. Look through
your working now. You Shannon

190
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,829
Daniels. I think you guys did
the most initially on the

191
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:51,545
website at the start.

192
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,130
Yeah. I tried to leave this

193
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,530
JavaScript. He's not gonna
transfer my Java knowledge into

194
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,330
JavaScript really easily. Yeah,
and Java Scripts a lot easier,

195
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,648
right? It is, it is.

196
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,262
Say for you guys. So if you
wanna use any of that you can

197
00:12:11,262 --> 00:12:14,100
just yeah, and I explained how
it's how it's working so.

198
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:22,490
Good. Well, alright, so we
can just review the content. I

199
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:28,262
guess everybody's had a chance
to take a look at what's on the

200
00:12:28,262 --> 00:12:32,882
website. In the different
sections and happy I've picked

201
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:36,518
up anytime anyone picked up any
typos besides Betty.

202
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:43,000
I was reading last night the
project idea an.

203
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,730
I understand sorry 'cause the
project idea on the websites

204
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:51,699
wrong. Oh no, no. This document
by the document. Yeah, there's a

205
00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:55,389
document I put under report,
project ideas, final report. I

206
00:12:55,389 --> 00:13:00,186
think it is Adams review. I
think it said it did say Adams

207
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:04,983
Review and then I had Daniel
sign off on the changes. So it's

208
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:09,042
if you go to files that's
actually now just called Project

209
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:10,149
ID dash revision.

210
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,146
OK, James wouldn't let me update
the other link. It's like no,

211
00:13:15,146 --> 00:13:16,961
I'm not, you're not allowed.

212
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,780
OK, it's like I wanted to update
the what I was working on the

213
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,200
project idea, but Daniel had it
open so I wrote all this stuff

214
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,240
but it wouldn't save so yeah.

215
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,204
As soon as I click close on,
teams are still gone away. What

216
00:13:33,204 --> 00:13:37,236
on my lucky I had it in Word as
well. Something like copy paste

217
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:40,116
and then I'm just typing
messages into the document. Can

218
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:42,132
you close it so I could say?

219
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,072
Did you get to see where the
cursor is? Well, there editing

220
00:13:46,072 --> 00:13:47,860
it. There.

221
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,841
Alright, I will be leaving the
red button when we do this. When

222
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:58,742
I do this admission 'cause I was
talking to Daniel he he just

223
00:13:58,742 --> 00:14:01,004
wants me to submit the PDF2.

224
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,178
Um canvas So that it's
easier.

225
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,250
Unless anybody else wants to.

226
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,260
Sorry, what

227
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,850
was that? Turn on Sunday, 'cause
I just assumed Daniel is gonna

228
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,258
submit the PDF assignment but he
just said like yesterday when I

229
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:24,666
was talking to him. He just
wants me to submit the PDF

230
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,802
report for the group.

231
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,236
So I was just asking do we wanna
wait the red button and stuff?

232
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,659
I see one.

233
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,196
Nice yeah, I think Tim might get
a kick out there. Any penalties

234
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:39,556
if you leave it there?

235
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:45,171
No, no yeah, I didn't get any
penalties for foot jokes in my

236
00:14:45,171 --> 00:14:46,956
assessment. One in the source

237
00:14:46,956 --> 00:14:51,900
code. It's just the yeah, yeah,
should be good.

238
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,430
Thomas, we can still turn it

239
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,566
off. Yeah, it makes him like 10

240
00:14:55,566 --> 00:15:00,040
seconds. My say 10 seconds, but
I think it's 15 seconds. I think

241
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,460
I I think I never obtained it.
What it takes to it.

242
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,470
Anything

243
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:12,496
else? Do we keep
the discord mentioned in the

244
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:14,710
tools? I was just gonna leave

245
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,710
it. OK.

246
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,060
Uh, 'cause I think the only
reason that they say that they

247
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,910
don't want discord or you may
get marked down for using

248
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,110
discord is the the lack of
ability to have a history of

249
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,210
what was said and by who.

250
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:39,258
Because generally you can't just
copy and paste out of GitHub,

251
00:15:39,258 --> 00:15:41,698
GitHub, discord and save it

252
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:44,608
somewhere. And you can't
record the videos.

253
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,320
So any meetings?

254
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,971
We all addicted discord
discussion, which is like little

255
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:56,799
itty bitty pick stuff. And then
when we came to a conclusion

256
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,308
that got transferred to teams
anyway, yeah, so I'm just gonna

257
00:16:00,308 --> 00:16:03,817
put it there just for the sake
of completeness. 'cause you

258
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:07,964
know, we did cover a couple of
things or wake people up on

259
00:16:07,964 --> 00:16:09,878
discord to get him to come

260
00:16:09,878 --> 00:16:14,420
across the teams. So it just
shows that we were able to use

261
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,654
multiple tools to accomplish the
task, but we kept all the

262
00:16:17,654 --> 00:16:21,476
professional stuff on teams and
some out of what you call out of

263
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:22,652
band communication on discord.

264
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:30,990
Cool targets phone in there.
Don't see any reason why they

265
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,730
marked down for.

266
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,216
Actually, like if we had a
meeting in person like you

267
00:16:37,216 --> 00:16:41,128
wouldn't record the meeting in
person. So or if you had a

268
00:16:41,128 --> 00:16:45,200
conversation in person. How
would you record that to put it

269
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,090
on the website kind of thing?

270
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,400
Thing go.

271
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,664
Alright, OK, well we've got an
extra person for the meeting.

272
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,880
Supervise.

273
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:08,290
It's just a look teams as I mean
it's alright, but it's chats

274
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,870
very awkward. It is.

275
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,700
Specially when you're trying to
read back through the replies

276
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,461
and the message boards and it's
there 'cause you're like, where

277
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:21,975
did they reply to that? And then
it goes. Goes bold and you click

278
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:25,740
on it and then I don't see the
reply, but it says I do an

279
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,308
activity. And then I click on
activity. Then I click on the

280
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:32,402
thing and then it takes me back
to the same place and the

281
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:35,032
message is there. This is worse

282
00:17:35,032 --> 00:17:41,000
than canvas. Oh, I wouldn't go
that, at least is the canvas.

283
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,088
Describes it fit him, so if he
watches this evening, will be

284
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:50,328
honestly the reason why we left
it in there, yeah.

285
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,268
And I think.

286
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:00,245
IT work, I think all we had to
do was put the answers to those

287
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,755
questions which we've done with
them's transcript. Yeah, I sort

288
00:18:03,755 --> 00:18:09,025
of. Put all his answers in the
underneath these questions so so

289
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:11,215
it's easier for them to see

290
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,700
grow. Yeah.

291
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,718
Yeah, that was good.

292
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,690
What question, Oh yeah, the that
matrix or what is it?

293
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:27,710
No no no. Yeah Steve. Like just
the interview we did. So yeah

294
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:32,739
yeah. I just got the subtitles
and clean him up a bit and made

295
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:36,495
it to answer the questions that
was supposed to ask. Germany put

296
00:18:36,495 --> 00:18:40,251
numbers next to the questions.
It will supposed to ask or like

297
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:44,007
a dot point or something just to
make him stand out more.

298
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,200
Oh yeah. Like

299
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,930
'cause I think we numbered
the questions anyway.

300
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,820
Yeah, it might might help.

301
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,405
And I did include a couple of
the follow up questions you and

302
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:04,195
Mattie said as well with you.

303
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,599
This can be like start talking
about something a little bit

304
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:10,998
different and you sort of needed
to have the context for

305
00:19:10,998 --> 00:19:13,030
clarification and yeah. Yeah.

306
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:19,560
I like the only thing I need to
get done now is I did make

307
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,540
direct changes to the website.

308
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:26,363
In information I put in, so I'll
just have to transfer that back

309
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:30,815
to documents in the mastery in
teens, teens and git teams and

310
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:34,909
get, yeah. 'cause he's gonna
look at what's loaded files to

311
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:36,033
teams then get home.

312
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,772
Apparently. Sorry, I was also

313
00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:44,594
gonna just. Add a few things
into like ideal jobs.

314
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,708
Just another paragraph maybe?

315
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,809
Just to make it stand out, yeah.

316
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:59,444
Oh, once we submit, everybody's
gonna do a fork of the

317
00:19:59,444 --> 00:20:01,470
project. On GitHub.

318
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,144
It's not as well, yeah, so we've
all meant to have our own copy

319
00:20:07,144 --> 00:20:08,324
of it in our repo's.

320
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,465
So you just gotta go to
thegithub.com, select Daniels

321
00:20:12,465 --> 00:20:17,470
thing and have it on Master and
just click fork and all four

322
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:21,370
should fork. Both branches.

323
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,238
The website and the the. In
theory I haven't, I haven't

324
00:20:26,238 --> 00:20:28,566
tested it, but it's supposed to.

325
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,180
I'll test it now, I'll get you

326
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,940
on the phone.
Folk.

327
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,417
At my only folk, like the
Master branch, but I'm just

328
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:45,180
I'm just checking it's gonna
take a few minutes.

329
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,666
No, that's

330
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,754
pretty. But we're pretty much

331
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:57,520
complete. And when is that?

332
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,460
When is that spark plus things
gonna be done at the park

333
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,180
Sunday? Two weeks or something.
He said to do it, oh.

334
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,352
Yeah, did they are
in no rush for that.

335
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,146
Because yeah, that they
extended that because they

336
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:20,953
didn't have all the complete
groups to put in to activate

337
00:21:20,953 --> 00:21:23,138
all the different group
accounts.

338
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:29,350
Which is like Dave and even told
us how to log into it yet.

339
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,809
Does anyone know how to log into

340
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:36,614
the? Does spark cluster I've

341
00:21:36,614 --> 00:21:41,110
tried? I I don't have enough. I
got a link or maybe.

342
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:48,244
Or not. Would it be on the 8 two
or something? Or I don't know.

343
00:21:48,244 --> 00:21:51,852
There's like, yeah it's it's. Is
it under this assessment is

344
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:56,444
spark plus like this part not a
two. So it's like I don't know

345
00:21:56,444 --> 00:22:00,052
if it's feedback about our sign
was in feedback about them.

346
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,415
The notification you from the

347
00:22:03,415 --> 00:22:07,770
clap. Is sharing
his Clapper rent?

348
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:15,970
Groups need to be finalized for
assessment to before I can put

349
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:20,875
in the group member details into
spark plus system.

350
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,290
Sadly, there have been a number
emails from students having

351
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,915
issues with the communications
participations their groups.

352
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,480
So students groups are still
fluctuate. ING. Spark plus will

353
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,297
be open to beyond the assignment
to deadline, so that's OK.

354
00:22:36,297 --> 00:22:39,420
'cause apparently they had
students that were in groups

355
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,237
that they won't own groups in
canvas that were in another

356
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:46,360
group and we're responding to
their actual growth, yeah?

357
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:47,890
So.

358
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:53,680
I'm just here. The assessment to
obviously the due date

359
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,572
contribute contribution form 2.

360
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,040
Four days after and he still
waiting on groups to

361
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,984
actually be groups before
spark plus is released.

362
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,248
Which makes you feel
bad for those people.

363
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,390
Or maybe it's their
fault?

364
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,758
Hey could be their own fault.

365
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,044
I mean it, it isn't online
course like we got pretty lucky

366
00:23:25,044 --> 00:23:26,804
that our team I think.

367
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,923
Right, so I think all teams
that have actually got content

368
00:23:29,923 --> 00:23:33,319
were created around the same
time as ours. We just got more

369
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,168
content and then.

370
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,960
I think it was only like
4 teams.

371
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,368
Yeah, it wasn't many
teams ready.

372
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,032
So I don't know if you saw our
discord links. We were posting

373
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:52,046
at one stage, Samuel, where we
went through more hunting GitHub

374
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:55,060
for all the other assignment.
Yeah so sorry couple of the

375
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,896
sorry couple of the websites so
the one that was like a just a

376
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:02,184
template and then the other one
that was just a great page.

377
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,260
Yeah.

378
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:08,330
I think it was Shannon that said
it was market research. We

379
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,490
weren't stalking them at all. I
said that I said that to you.

380
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:18,645
Market research. You're going
to see what they're doing.

381
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:24,181
Well, I reckon if looked at
hours and just haven't said

382
00:24:24,181 --> 00:24:28,702
anything like if we worked out
to search for the assignment

383
00:24:28,702 --> 00:24:31,168
that they want it named as.

384
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,038
I'm sure other groups
did as well.

385
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:43,243
Alright, is there anything else
that we wanted to mention on

386
00:24:43,243 --> 00:24:47,592
this meeting? Help me **** This
is a hot wheel track.

387
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,986
Yeah 60 James raise these first
meeting agenda item.

388
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:58,413
And it has a trailer that
expensive to put all his cars on

389
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:03,825
it and then drive it around. But
sometimes they get stuck, yeah?

390
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:09,740
Yeah. Yeah it's not
showing till date.

391
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,326
It's different,

392
00:25:13,326 --> 00:25:17,425
yes? Thank you any other thing
is like what should be working

393
00:25:17,425 --> 00:25:18,600
on today to get it.

394
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,388
So today I wanna make any
changes to your stuff. Today is

395
00:25:24,388 --> 00:25:30,254
the last day kind of because we
need to give Mattie some time to

396
00:25:30,254 --> 00:25:32,768
be able to copy and paste

397
00:25:32,768 --> 00:25:39,440
everything. I've got to complete
on the project idea two

398
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,290
sections, oh. And the end of 1
Section 'cause I wasn't sure

399
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,380
what we wanted to put his
innovation under description. So

400
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:51,088
we're just going to say that
we're going to use AI and

401
00:25:51,088 --> 00:25:54,487
machine learning in the future
to be able to scrape website

402
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:57,886
that the social media websites
to adjust settings for the user.

403
00:25:57,886 --> 00:26:01,594
And then I just got a complete
tools and technology which is

404
00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:05,611
I've put some night rough notes
in there. What we need. So I've

405
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:09,937
just got to go through and say
why we need it. Add some images

406
00:26:09,937 --> 00:26:13,027
and then the schools required
and why we need it.

407
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,610
Otherwise it's done.

408
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,593
And then I've just gotta
do my group reflection.

409
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,430
So, but this is the.

410
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,180
Changes in.

411
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:33,175
What I was gonna say. Tools and
technologies. Others at the

412
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,545
subject we gonna touch in the

413
00:26:35,545 --> 00:26:39,619
next meeting. Just if we
finished tools and technology,

414
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:43,663
what you just said about it.
They just two sections of the

415
00:26:43,663 --> 00:26:47,370
project idea that I haven't
finished yet. OK, so that's what

416
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,055
I'm gonna be doing today.

417
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:54,678
And if you guys want to make any
changes to any of your content,

418
00:26:54,678 --> 00:26:59,606
do so to today so that we can go
through and check everything to

419
00:26:59,606 --> 00:27:01,366
make sure it's alright tomorrow.

420
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:07,206
And that gives many time to
transfer it to the PDF. If you

421
00:27:07,206 --> 00:27:10,824
change anything on the
website, please make sure you

422
00:27:10,824 --> 00:27:14,442
update the GitHub Word
document version and the teams

423
00:27:14,442 --> 00:27:16,452
version of that file, yeah?

424
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,490
Yeah.

425
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,718
That's pretty much it.

426
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:27,820
And then we can submit on the
original submission date I guess

427
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,550
and hopefully get some sort of

428
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,700
prize. Not that much to go.

429
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,516
Yeah. And

430
00:27:36,516 --> 00:27:41,238
everything tonight. I can tell
you what we changed, yeah?

431
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,760
Cool. Sounds good.

432
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,997
Yeah, overview of what we
changed. Um Ann just will just

433
00:27:49,997 --> 00:27:53,704
review the group reflection as
well for the other people that

434
00:27:53,704 --> 00:27:57,411
weren't weren't here since we
don't have any concerns with the

435
00:27:57,411 --> 00:27:59,096
site, we don't need to.

436
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,836
Mention them at the next
meeting, either now who's

437
00:28:02,836 --> 00:28:03,932
attending the other meeting

438

Nothing. It should be alright. I

450
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:53,602
Alright, set off set aside my
weekend just to finalize it all,

451
00:28:53,602 --> 00:28:54,730
even they'd be.

452
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:59,826
But it kind of looks like I
don't need to do that much at

453
00:28:59,826 --> 00:29:03,666
all, no, really. I'll be
available most of the day if

454
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:07,236
anybody needs help with
anything, I'll get stuck or one

455
00:29:07,236 --> 00:29:08,664
spinner review anything they've

456
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:12,030
written. So. If that helps.

457
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,630
And probably we can conclude
this meeting less is anything

458
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,276
else you guys want to mention

459
00:29:20,276 --> 00:29:25,131
before. We got on Earth.
No, I think I've already

460
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:26,268
covered everything, yeah.

461
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,630
I'll stop the recording.

462
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,320
