		<h4>Autonomous Vehicles</h4>

		<h5>What do autonomous vehicles do?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Autonomous vehicles are self-driving or computer-driven forms of transport - usually cars- that do not require the 
		full control of a human or none at all to operate safely on the road. In 2016 the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) created a standard 
		for Levels of Driving Automation J3016 (SAE International that include levels 0 through to 5. Here is their original description of these levels:<br /><br />

		<h6>What's the state of this technology?</h6>
		<p class="pt-2">Driverless cars are capable of using a wide range of technologies in order to function safely in a constantly changing traffic environment. 
		Here is some of the most up to date technology:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>High resolution cameras are placed on every side of the care and are used to get a 360-degree view of the surroundings. 
			These cameras vary in their field of view, some being wide and having a short range, others being narrow with a longer range. 
			Cameras create a great 2D picture of what is around the car but cannot provide depth of vision for the computer to understand. 
			Additionally, cameras are quite limited in their effectiveness in dark, dusty, foggy, snowy or rainy environments. 
			High resolution cameras must be used alongside other technologies in order to give cars autonomous functions.</li>
			<li>Radar is the use of radio waves to detect the location and speed of other objects - usually cars. 
			This is done by sending out pulses of radio waves that bounce back off of objects. 
			The returning radio waves are then sensed by the car and provide information on the proximity of surrounding objects. 
			Radar can also be used by boats, ships, aircrafts and meteorologist to detect weather changes.</li>
			<li>Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is the use of lasers to create a 3D image of the earth or objects. 
			These lasers are fast and invisible and function similarly to radar.  However, LiDAR detects much more information so provides 
			more opportunity for car autonomy.</li>
			<li>Thermal cameras are used to detect living things such as people and animals in a traffic environment. 
			This can aid greatly in developing safety measures for driverless cars because the safety of humans should be the number on priority. </li>
			<li>Ultrasound is similar to radar in that it sends out signals to measure how quickly they bounce back to get an idea of how far away objects are. 
			This can be very accurate at short distances in clear environments. For this reason, ultrasound is often used in cars to aid with self-parking.  </li>
			<li>Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) or global positioning systems (GPS) are used to approximate where the car is on the globe. 
			This can be accurate up to a few meters or more. While this is not a new technology, it is still used by the autonomous vehicles made today.  </li>
			<li>Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are used to identify the position and movements of the car, where it has been and where it is now.  </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h6>What can be done now?</h6>
		<p>The most well-known and advanced technology in this area seems to be Waymo One. Waymo One is Google’s sister company that launched its first commercial autonomous 
		taxi service within the metro Phoenix area in December 2018. The service was first provided to just a few select customers who were a part of the Early Rider Program. 
		These cars were always accompanied by a driver at the time but now that the Waymo One service is available to the rest of the public in the metro Phoenix area, 
		some of the autonomous cars are completely driverless. The Early Rider Program is still in progress in order to provide early feature access and to collect 
		valuable research on these features. Waymo One is considered to be at level 4 in driving automation as it is still restricted to the Phoenix area and still require 
		drivers some/most of the time for safety but essentially do all of the driving themselves.</p>
		<p>As far as autonomous cars that are available to the public, Tesla is probably leading the way. They already provide cars that are well and truly 
		classified as level 2, some have level 3 functions and in some cases level 4 driving on highways and more. However, these cars are said to be capable of 
		level 5 autonomy after some software updates.</p>
		<p>‘I remain confident that we will have the basic functionality for level 5 autonomy complete this year’
		(Elon Musk talks Autopilot and Level 5 Autonomy at China AI conference, Teslacn 2020).</p>
		<p>With Waymo One already having level 5 autonomous cars and Tesla stating that they plan to reach level 5 autonomy this year, 
		it seems that autonomous cars could become quite popular within the next three years or even as soon as next year. 
		The prices of the currently available Teslas in Australia range from around $79,556 for the cheapest Model 3 or up to $187,373 for the dearest Model X. 
		However, the upcoming Cybertruck that will release in 2021 will be available for as low as $39,900 (Tesla 2020). 
		It is noted that while this is Tesla’s Australian website, there is no clear statement on whether these are US prices or AU prices, 
		while the specs on these vehicles are indeed in US values - not AU - and other searches on these cars, external to Tesla, suggest that these prices may be in USD. 
		Either way, the prices of these vehicles seem quite reasonable and possibly quite accessible to the middle-class citizen here in Australia.</p>
		<p>While the service is on pause at the moment, there is a driverless bus service that runs the Geraldton Foreshore in Western Australia 
		that offers a 30-minute drive next to the beach. It is called the Intellibus and it is completely driverless, though does still have two people on board 
		who can take over the driving if necessary (RAC 2020)</p>
