		<h5>What do autonomous vehicles do?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Autonomous vehicles are self-driving or computer-driven forms of transport - usually cars- that do not require the 
		full control of a human or none at all to operate safely on the road. In 2016 the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) created a standard 
		for Levels of Driving Automation J3016 (SAE International that include levels 0 through to 5. Here is their original description of these levels:<br /><br />

		<h6>What's the state of this technology?</h6>
		<p class="pt-2">Driverless cars are capable of using a wide range of technologies in order to function safely in a constantly changing traffic environment. 
		Here is some of the most up to date technology:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>High resolution cameras are placed on every side of the care and are used to get a 360-degree view of the surroundings. 
			These cameras vary in their field of view, some being wide and having a short range, others being narrow with a longer range. 
			Cameras create a great 2D picture of what is around the car but cannot provide depth of vision for the computer to understand. 
			Additionally, cameras are quite limited in their effectiveness in dark, dusty, foggy, snowy or rainy environments. 
			High resolution cameras must be used alongside other technologies in order to give cars autonomous functions.</li>
			<li>Radar is the use of radio waves to detect the location and speed of other objects - usually cars. 
			This is done by sending out pulses of radio waves that bounce back off of objects. 
			The returning radio waves are then sensed by the car and provide information on the proximity of surrounding objects. 
			Radar can also be used by boats, ships, aircrafts and meteorologist to detect weather changes.</li>
			<li>Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is the use of lasers to create a 3D image of the earth or objects. 
			These lasers are fast and invisible and function similarly to radar.  However, LiDAR detects much more information so provides 
			more opportunity for car autonomy.</li>
			<li>Thermal cameras are used to detect living things such as people and animals in a traffic environment. 
			This can aid greatly in developing safety measures for driverless cars because the safety of humans should be the number on priority. </li>
			<li>Ultrasound is similar to radar in that it sends out signals to measure how quickly they bounce back to get an idea of how far away objects are. 
			This can be very accurate at short distances in clear environments. For this reason, ultrasound is often used in cars to aid with self-parking.  </li>
			<li>Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) or global positioning systems (GPS) are used to approximate where the car is on the globe. 
			This can be accurate up to a few meters or more. While this is not a new technology, it is still used by the autonomous vehicles made today.  </li>
			<li>Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are used to identify the position and movements of the car, where it has been and where it is now.  </li>
