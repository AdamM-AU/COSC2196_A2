		<h5>Ideal Job</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">My ideal job is will be in one of the fields of Cyber Security. The positions in cyber security vary in there own ways but keep the same basic knowedge under them. My main reasoning
			for this is to protect from any cyber-attacks that are occurring or may occur in the future to stay ahead of the hackers and implement fixes to prevent any intrusion. I believe my Ideal Job holds similarities
			to Adams as it has a lot of programming language based knowledge. There is some overlap of similarities with the others however the main goals are very different. To my understanding Maddie’s, Daniel’s, Sam’s and Jorge’s all hold very similar aspects of work.</p>
