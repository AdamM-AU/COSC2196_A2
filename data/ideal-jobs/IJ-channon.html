		<h4>Ideal Job</h4>
		<p class="pt-2">My ideal job is Cyber Security Analyst. The position of cyber security analyst is to find vulnerabilities and exploits in IT infrastructure. To protect from any cyber-attacks that are
		occurring or may occur in the future to stay ahead of the hackers and implement fixes to prevent any intrusion. I believe my Ideal Job holds similarities to Adams as it has a lot of programming language
		based knowledge. There is some overlap of similarities with the others however the main goals are very different. To my understanding Maddie’s, Daniel’s, Sam’s and Jorge’s all hold very similar aspects of work.</p>
