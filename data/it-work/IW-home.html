		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">The Fighting Mongooses had the opportunity to interview Steven Spiller, a senior software engineer for Microsoft, 
		specifically for the Xbox platform. Even though the upcoming release of the new Xbox was quickly approaching, and 
		Steven being extremely busy, we greatly appreciate the time Steve took to meet with us and we are extremely grateful 
		for the knowledge and passion that he shared with us.</p>
		
		<h5>Interview Transcript:</h5>
		
		<h6>Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h6>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">
		My name is Steven Spiller. You can just call me Steve. I work as a senior software engineer for Xbox/ Microsoft. 
		I work in a little team is called, well not so little anymore, but it's called ATG, the Advanced Technology Group. Our 
		role in the organization is to help game developers make the best use of the platform of Xbox. Specifically, I work in 
		networking and multiplayer systems. If titles are having trouble or they need advice, or they are behind this severely 
		behind and they can't get their stuff to work on our platform. Our team is the one that helps them out. It's not 
		as interesting on the networking multiplayer side, but the on the graphics side. Those are the guys that really help 
		titles tune on our platform so they'll be able to take traces of the games running, evaluate them, and offer back tips 
		that can help them run faster so they'll get games to run at least in the previous generation all the way at 1080p 
		instead of only 900p. Things like that. So really our goal is to make all the titles that run on Xbox the best they can 
		be on Xbox. I think that was our motto at one time.</p>
		
		<h6>Please tell us about the industry you work in?</h6>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Being at Microsoft, I've done a lot of things in a lot of different areas, but most recently we can just stay with 
		video games industry, so the Xbox stuff is what I've been working on since 2013. So the last seven years. Microsoft 
		provides platforms and services for game developers. It is a fairly large industry. You've got billions of dollars and 
		millions of millions of gamers across the across the world and that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to make things 
		better and easier for gamers across the entire world. Like a panacea of the world. Good way of saying that, but we want to 
		make everybody's life easier.</p>
		
		<h6>What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h6>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">In my role, I'll do things like answer simple questions on a developer forum that is specific for Xbox Partners. If 
		they have issues, that's one of the first places they'll go, so I'll do a little&nbsp;time answering those, and those can 
		be from really simple questions like <em>&ldquo;Is this supposed to work like this too?&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey, we're getting a 
		crash in this very strange situation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Can you help us figure that out?&rdquo;</em> I will investigate issues 
		that have been reported by external developers. I work directly with the platform team, the people that actually wrote all 
		the code. I work with them to get things figured out and resolve bugs, find gaps in our solutions. 
		I&rsquo;ve also developed&nbsp;samples and demonstrate best practices for using the platform and our services. For example, 
		if you want to know how to do multiplayer matchmaking through Xbox Live, we have specific examples and lots of documentation 
		that I put together to help with that. Then of course if people still have issues and they can come straight to us. Because 
		we do work straight not just from forums. We will also engage via email, a lot more on teams lately, over the phone and video 
		conferencing. We also go on site with developers to help them get issues resolved or to help them get their game working on 
		Xbox. I've done that several times. Which is it&rsquo;s kind of fun. It's very busy though. We also deliver content for 
		(what used to be) in-person conferences. We had to cancel the last few and turn them into digital only. I don't know what 
		the future holds as far as those go. We have several annual conferences. Directed around Xbox developers in gaming and we 
		provide educational training and. We&rsquo;ve done discussion sessions where people actually come out, listen to us and 
		talk, which is kind of fun.</p>
		
		<h6>Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</h6>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Yes, I do a lot of different things as you could tell right? And those have different people I work with, so when we're 
		developing new samples, we want them to have a consistent look and feel. We actually have designers, graphic designers that 
		help us design the UI flows and figure out what the scenarios that we want to show. Program managers, we actually call them 
		the <em>butt on the line</em>. These are the people that own features and are responsible for making sure that their status 
		is tracked correctly and that they're (the team) doing the right thing. All that work other software developers obviously, 
		and then we have another special type of person in the Xbox Organisation that we call <em>developer account managers 
		</em>(DAM)<em>. </em>&nbsp;These are the people that actually own the relationship with the different publishers. We have 
		one person that owns Electronic Arts. When Electronic Arts has any sort of problems, they need to do something, they want 
		to ask about future plans or anything related to this? They talk to their DAM and then their DAM will be the one that often 
		contacts us with specific issues or other problems they might be having, or if they just want advice on things, or <em>runs 
		the gamut</em>. Those roles are internal people. Then of course there is externals, which I think falls more under your 
		clients.</p>
		
		<h6>Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals?</h6>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">There's five people in my immediate team or my peers, and we all basically work on the same thing. There's a bunch of 
		teams like mine that take on the different areas of Xbox. So, you add audio, graphics, ours is networking, systems and CPU 
		and things like that. Of course, you have the whole platform side of things where the people actually write the OS. They 
		write the special Xbox layers on top of things and we interact with them quite often.</p>
		
		<h6>What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h6>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Most of the work I do is direct with clients. Either through a forum, through email, through teams and up to on-site visits. 
		The DAMs will set up what we call an engagement. If there's a real problem and we need to set aside time. If It's going to take 
		more than a day or so to look at this. They'll set up what's called an engagement, and then, depending on the level of that and 
		then other factors like, where are they located physically? Are there travel restrictions? Things like that. If there's a developer 
		that's just down the street (there are some that are like that), we will just go there because it's easier. Other times, we can do 
		things over the phone and over email. That actually works out fairly well. It&rsquo;s nice because it has a paper trail so we can 
		go back and reference this stuff again. So anytime we go, and we solve problems and we figure something out, we have this big 
		knowledge base (It's really a OneNote). We store all this information and so we can go back and search for it again.</p>
		
		<h6>What aspects of your work do you spend the most time on? Please tell us about these?</h6>
		<p class="pt-2">That is almost like a sine wave, right? We will go from where we are doing nothing but working with customers and right now 
		is one of those times. We have the new launch of the console coming up in a month. We have a ton of titles that are all trying 
		to certify, they're trying to get their stuff updated to the new platform. There's a lot of people all working in with new things 
		all at the same time, so we're quite busy answering questions and helping people figure out how things are supposed to work these 
		days.</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2">Then on the other side of that, you'll have these big lulls where people have become familiar with the platforms and the 
		systems. They don't have as many issues anymore and there's just not a lot of work going on. It is somewhat cyclical as to when 
		software or games are released. During those times we get to work on what we think of is more forward-looking items. So, we will 
		have incubation projects for new tools, new ideas, new services, as well as being able to do work where we're building up new 
		samples. New middleware projects etc. One thing that we don't offer a lot of is middleware. By that I mean things like the Unity 
		and Unreal engines. A lot of developers go to those because it it's <em>pre-canned</em> and has a lot of stuff. So, we work with 
		Epic and Unity to have Xbox platform support built in for everybody and sometimes we will do things like that. In fact, just 
		recently one of my colleagues and I finished adding a new platform piece that's called play fat party on Xbox. It is a pre-canned 
		voice and networking solution and now that's something that you can choose to use. If you use Unreal, you can say <em>&ldquo;I 
		want to use that piece.&rdquo;</em> You check the box and basically it just automatically starts using it because it's built 
		into their engine. We do some of that work too and that's a lot of fun, right? That's when you're spending more time coding than 
		troubleshooting. Other times it's more troubleshooting than coding . It's actually one of the things I like. It comes up later. 
		I think a lot of us would like to spend more time coding than dealing with some of the clients.</p>
		<p class="pt-2"><em>Adam: &ldquo;I think a lot of us would like to spend more time coding.&rdquo;</em></p>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Yeah, it's really hard. I've worked in a lot of different types of groups around Microsoft and no matter what, there is never 
		a job where you're just spending all your time writing code. There is just too many other things that have to be done as part of 
		the process of shipping software that you can't get away from.</p>
		
		<h6>Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h6>
