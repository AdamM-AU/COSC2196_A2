		<h5>Motivation</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">The motivation for this app was to empower users of social media to take back control of their online presence and educate them 
		on the security and privacy issues associated with their social media use. Humans are social creatures and the digital era didn’t change this, but it 
		did change the way we communicate. Using social media we have instant access to millions of peoples and we have new ways of interaction. But the social 
		media has security risks. It is used also by criminals for fraud, gathering business intelligence, stealing sensitive information etc (Tayouri 2015).
		The rise of the social web has traditionally been accompanied by privacy concerns (Netter, Herbst & Pernul 2011).  Many people may not be aware of how 
		much information about themselves they are not aware they are sharing online to the public and how secure their various social media accounts are how 
		vulnerable they truly are. How a person has their social media’s security and privacy settings setup makes a substantial difference in determining how 
		much information about them is available to anyone online and how secure their account is in terms of being vulnerable to hacking or other interference 
		or breaches. Because we’re passionate about privacy and security awareness will wanted to put users in control of their social media environment and personal 
		data exposure. We believe this app will be useful in achieving that aim.</p>
