		<h5>Outcome</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">If this project is successful, the user will have their social media security and privacy settings aligned with their own personal preference
			and be only sharing what information they deem fit. Users will be confident they can use social media safely and securely knowing their accounts are safe 
			from interference and their data and personal information is secure are protected. Hopefully users will be educated in the risks associated with social 
			media use and the appropriate settings and measures to take place to mitigate those risks, allowing them to enjoy the benefits of social media and avoid
			the numerous pitfalls. With the app monitoring for changes that social media platforms may make to any security or privacy practices or practices, users
			will also be protected into the future and have no need to be anxious about any adverse changes going unnoticed. The original problem of poor social media 
			security and privacy will be solved, and user's awareness and education will be improved.
		<br>The potential drawbacks are the need to have the app running in the background to allow it to provide notifications about settings changes and
			the need for the app to be updated periodically. Because the app may not be able to make the settings changes itself and will have to rely on the user 
			successfully following tutorials, human error may mean some changes may not actually take affect but the user will think they have giving them a false 
			sense of security. Or the user may give up making the changes if the task is too laborious or complicated which it sometimes can be when navigating social 
			media security settings - they arenâ€™t always the easiest to locate. Another potential obstacle we anticipate is keeping up with the changes in a timely
			manner and having new tutorial videos ready. The tutorial videos must also be easy to follow and aimed at novices which will need testing - the videos 
			could seem easy to follow to ourselves who have IT experience, but we may leave some people behind. We will keep this in mind during development to make
			sure the app is effective. With appropriate measures and safeguards we believe this app has the potential to make a real difference in improving social
			media security and privacy so it can be used safely and be the enjoyable experience it set out to be without the risk.  </p>
