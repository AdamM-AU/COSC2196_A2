		<h5>Overview</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Our Project is a privacy checking app that scans settings in Facebook and other social media platforms to allow the user to be more secure, 
		it has pop-ups to tell them they are not secure and will explain to them what they are sharing and with who and guide them in a process of how to become safe and 
		secure. It will primarily use tutorial video links. The project idea is an app for both Android and iOS, that will evaluate an individual's privacy settings that 
		they have on their various social media accounts, be it Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, or WeChat, with the ability to expand and add more later. The app will work 
		by the user giving permission to access their social media accounts with their login details to allow the app to then check their privacy and security settings. 
		For example, like on Facebook are their posts public, are their Pictures public that they don't need to be besides their profile pictures and then it will make 
		recommendations based on what we found. The app can't directly change any settings (at this point). A lot of the settings for them, so the idea is that will say hey, 
		this is bad. This is bad. This is bad and here are some videos that we can link you to on that we've created on YouTube with a step by step tutorial showing them how 
		to resolve those security issues.  It will also push notifications to notify them if their privacy agreements with the social media platforms are changed or update
		by the provider. So basically, it's going to do a security and privacy checkup.</p>
