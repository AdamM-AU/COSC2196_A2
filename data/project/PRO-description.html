		<h5>Description</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">The project is an app for Android and iOS smartphones. It will check the security and privacy settings of the user's social media accounts, 
			highlight concerns and make recommendations to improve the safety of their data and personal information. The user will be given links to tutorials
			demonstrating how to make changes to their settings and navigate the labyrinth of menus purposely designed that way to make sure users share as much data
			as possible by default to allow the company to achieve maximum monetisation. Notifications will be used as the method of keeping users up to date in 
			changes of company policies that affect security and privacy so they will continue to be protected over time. The Social Media accounts the app will begin
			with are Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and WeChat. More platforms can be easily added later such as Snapchat, LinkedIn and Pinterest among many others.<br>
